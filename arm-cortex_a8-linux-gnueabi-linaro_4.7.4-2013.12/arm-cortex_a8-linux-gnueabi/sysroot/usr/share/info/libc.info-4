11.2.3 File Name Errors
-----------------------

Functions that accept file name arguments usually detect these 'errno'
error conditions relating to the file name syntax or trouble finding the
named file.  These errors are referred to throughout this manual as the
"usual file name errors".

'EACCES'
     The process does not have search permission for a directory
     component of the file name.

'ENAMETOOLONG'
     This error is used when either the total length of a file name is
     greater than 'PATH_MAX', or when an individual file name component
     has a length greater than 'NAME_MAX'.  *Note Limits for Files::.

     On GNU/Hurd systems, there is no imposed limit on overall file name
     length, but some file systems may place limits on the length of a
     component.

'ENOENT'
     This error is reported when a file referenced as a directory
     component in the file name doesn't exist, or when a component is a
     symbolic link whose target file does not exist.  *Note Symbolic
     Links::.

'ENOTDIR'
     A file that is referenced as a directory component in the file name
     exists, but it isn't a directory.

'ELOOP'
     Too many symbolic links were resolved while trying to look up the
     file name.  The system has an arbitrary limit on the number of
     symbolic links that may be resolved in looking up a single file
     name, as a primitive way to detect loops.  *Note Symbolic Links::.


File: libc.info,  Node: File Name Portability,  Prev: File Name Errors,  Up: File Names

11.2.4 Portability of File Names
--------------------------------

The rules for the syntax of file names discussed in *note File Names::,
are the rules normally used by GNU systems and by other POSIX systems.
However, other operating systems may use other conventions.

   There are two reasons why it can be important for you to be aware of
file name portability issues:

   * If your program makes assumptions about file name syntax, or
     contains embedded literal file name strings, it is more difficult
     to get it to run under other operating systems that use different
     syntax conventions.

   * Even if you are not concerned about running your program on
     machines that run other operating systems, it may still be possible
     to access files that use different naming conventions.  For
     example, you may be able to access file systems on another computer
     running a different operating system over a network, or read and
     write disks in formats used by other operating systems.

   The ISO C standard says very little about file name syntax, only that
file names are strings.  In addition to varying restrictions on the
length of file names and what characters can validly appear in a file
name, different operating systems use different conventions and syntax
for concepts such as structured directories and file types or
extensions.  Some concepts such as file versions might be supported in
some operating systems and not by others.

   The POSIX.1 standard allows implementations to put additional
restrictions on file name syntax, concerning what characters are
permitted in file names and on the length of file name and file name
component strings.  However, on GNU systems, any character except the
null character is permitted in a file name string, and on GNU/Hurd
systems there are no limits on the length of file name strings.

12.1 Streams
============

For historical reasons, the type of the C data structure that represents
a stream is called 'FILE' rather than "stream".  Since most of the
library functions deal with objects of type 'FILE *', sometimes the term
"file pointer" is also used to mean "stream".  This leads to unfortunate
confusion over terminology in many books on C. This manual, however, is
careful to use the terms "file" and "stream" only in the technical
sense.

   The 'FILE' type is declared in the header file 'stdio.h'.

 -- Data Type: FILE
     This is the data type used to represent stream objects.  A 'FILE'
     object holds all of the internal state information about the
     connection to the associated file, including such things as the
     file position indicator and buffering information.  Each stream
     also has error and end-of-file status indicators that can be tested
     with the 'ferror' and 'feof' functions; see *note EOF and Errors::.

   'FILE' objects are allocated and managed internally by the
input/output library functions.  Don't try to create your own objects of
type 'FILE'; let the library do it.  Your programs should deal only with
pointers to these objects (that is, 'FILE *' values) rather than the
objects themselves.

12.2 Standard Streams
=====================

When the 'main' function of your program is invoked, it already has
three predefined streams open and available for use.  These represent
the "standard" input and output channels that have been established for
the process.

   These streams are declared in the header file 'stdio.h'.

 -- Variable: FILE * stdin
     The "standard input" stream, which is the normal source of input
     for the program.

 -- Variable: FILE * stdout
     The "standard output" stream, which is used for normal output from
     the program.

 -- Variable: FILE * stderr
     The "standard error" stream, which is used for error messages and
     diagnostics issued by the program.

   On GNU systems, you can specify what files or processes correspond to
these streams using the pipe and redirection facilities provided by the
shell.  (The primitives shells use to implement these facilities are
described in *note File System Interface::.)  Most other operating
systems provide similar mechanisms, but the details of how to use them
can vary.

   In the GNU C Library, 'stdin', 'stdout', and 'stderr' are normal
variables which you can set just like any others.  For example, to
redirect the standard output to a file, you could do:

     fclose (stdout);
     stdout = fopen ("standard-output-file", "w");

   Note however, that in other systems 'stdin', 'stdout', and 'stderr'
are macros that you cannot assign to in the normal way.  But you can use
'freopen' to get the effect of closing one and reopening it.  *Note
Opening Streams::.

   The three streams 'stdin', 'stdout', and 'stderr' are not unoriented
at program start (*note Streams and I18N::).

12.3 Opening Streams
====================

Opening a file with the 'fopen' function creates a new stream and
establishes a connection between the stream and a file.  This may
involve creating a new file.

   Everything described in this section is declared in the header file
'stdio.h'.

 -- Function: FILE * fopen (const char *FILENAME, const char *OPENTYPE)
     The 'fopen' function opens a stream for I/O to the file FILENAME,
     and returns a pointer to the stream.

     The OPENTYPE argument is a string that controls how the file is
     opened and specifies attributes of the resulting stream.  It must
     begin with one of the following sequences of characters:

     'r'
          Open an existing file for reading only.

     'w'
          Open the file for writing only.  If the file already exists,
          it is truncated to zero length.  Otherwise a new file is
          created.

     'a'
          Open a file for append access; that is, writing at the end of
          file only.  If the file already exists, its initial contents
          are unchanged and output to the stream is appended to the end
          of the file.  Otherwise, a new, empty file is created.

     'r+'
          Open an existing file for both reading and writing.  The
          initial contents of the file are unchanged and the initial
          file position is at the beginning of the file.

     'w+'
          Open a file for both reading and writing.  If the file already
          exists, it is truncated to zero length.  Otherwise, a new file
          is created.

     'a+'
          Open or create file for both reading and appending.  If the
          file exists, its initial contents are unchanged.  Otherwise, a
          new file is created.  The initial file position for reading is
          at the beginning of the file, but output is always appended to
          the end of the file.

     As you can see, '+' requests a stream that can do both input and
     output.  When using such a stream, you must call 'fflush' (*note
     Stream Buffering::) or a file positioning function such as 'fseek'
     (*note File Positioning::) when switching from reading to writing
     or vice versa.  Otherwise, internal buffers might not be emptied
     properly.

     Additional characters may appear after these to specify flags for
     the call.  Always put the mode ('r', 'w+', etc.)  first; that is
     the only part you are guaranteed will be understood by all systems.

     The GNU C Library defines additional characters for use in
     OPENTYPE:

     'c'
          The file is opened with cancellation in the I/O functions
          disabled.

     'e'
          The underlying file descriptor will be closed if you use any
          of the 'exec...' functions (*note Executing a File::).  (This
          is equivalent to having set 'FD_CLOEXEC' on that descriptor.
          *Note Descriptor Flags::.)

     'm'
          The file is opened and accessed using 'mmap'.  This is only
          supported with files opened for reading.

     'x'
          Insist on creating a new file--if a file FILENAME already
          exists, 'fopen' fails rather than opening it.  If you use 'x'
          you are guaranteed that you will not clobber an existing file.
          This is equivalent to the 'O_EXCL' option to the 'open'
          function (*note Opening and Closing Files::).

          The 'x' modifier is part of ISO C11.

     The character 'b' in OPENTYPE has a standard meaning; it requests a
     binary stream rather than a text stream.  But this makes no
     difference in POSIX systems (including GNU systems).  If both '+'
     and 'b' are specified, they can appear in either order.  *Note
     Binary Streams::.

     If the OPENTYPE string contains the sequence ',ccs=STRING' then
     STRING is taken as the name of a coded character set and 'fopen'
     will mark the stream as wide-oriented with appropriate conversion
     functions in place to convert from and to the character set STRING.
     Any other stream is opened initially unoriented and the orientation
     is decided with the first file operation.  If the first operation
     is a wide character operation, the stream is not only marked as
     wide-oriented, also the conversion functions to convert to the
     coded character set used for the current locale are loaded.  This
     will not change anymore from this point on even if the locale
     selected for the 'LC_CTYPE' category is changed.

     Any other characters in OPENTYPE are simply ignored.  They may be
     meaningful in other systems.

     If the open fails, 'fopen' returns a null pointer.

     When the sources are compiling with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32 bit machine this function is in fact 'fopen64' since the LFS
     interface replaces transparently the old interface.

   You can have multiple streams (or file descriptors) pointing to the
same file open at the same time.  If you do only input, this works
straightforwardly, but you must be careful if any output streams are
included.  *Note Stream/Descriptor Precautions::.  This is equally true
whether the streams are in one program (not usual) or in several
programs (which can easily happen).  It may be advantageous to use the
file locking facilities to avoid simultaneous access.  *Note File
Locks::.

 -- Function: FILE * fopen64 (const char *FILENAME, const char
          *OPENTYPE)
     This function is similar to 'fopen' but the stream it returns a
     pointer for is opened using 'open64'.  Therefore this stream can be
     used even on files larger then 2^31 bytes on 32 bit machines.

     Please note that the return type is still 'FILE *'.  There is no
     special 'FILE' type for the LFS interface.

     If the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a 32
     bits machine this function is available under the name 'fopen' and
     so transparently replaces the old interface.

 -- Macro: int FOPEN_MAX
     The value of this macro is an integer constant expression that
     represents the minimum number of streams that the implementation
     guarantees can be open simultaneously.  You might be able to open
     more than this many streams, but that is not guaranteed.  The value
     of this constant is at least eight, which includes the three
     standard streams 'stdin', 'stdout', and 'stderr'.  In POSIX.1
     systems this value is determined by the 'OPEN_MAX' parameter; *note
     General Limits::.  In BSD and GNU, it is controlled by the
     'RLIMIT_NOFILE' resource limit; *note Limits on Resources::.

 -- Function: FILE * freopen (const char *FILENAME, const char
          *OPENTYPE, FILE *STREAM)
     This function is like a combination of 'fclose' and 'fopen'.  It
     first closes the stream referred to by STREAM, ignoring any errors
     that are detected in the process.  (Because errors are ignored, you
     should not use 'freopen' on an output stream if you have actually
     done any output using the stream.)  Then the file named by FILENAME
     is opened with mode OPENTYPE as for 'fopen', and associated with
     the same stream object STREAM.

     If the operation fails, a null pointer is returned; otherwise,
     'freopen' returns STREAM.

     'freopen' has traditionally been used to connect a standard stream
     such as 'stdin' with a file of your own choice.  This is useful in
     programs in which use of a standard stream for certain purposes is
     hard-coded.  In the GNU C Library, you can simply close the
     standard streams and open new ones with 'fopen'.  But other systems
     lack this ability, so using 'freopen' is more portable.

     When the sources are compiling with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32 bit machine this function is in fact 'freopen64' since the LFS
     interface replaces transparently the old interface.

 -- Function: FILE * freopen64 (const char *FILENAME, const char
          *OPENTYPE, FILE *STREAM)
     This function is similar to 'freopen'.  The only difference is that
     on 32 bit machine the stream returned is able to read beyond the
     2^31 bytes limits imposed by the normal interface.  It should be
     noted that the stream pointed to by STREAM need not be opened using
     'fopen64' or 'freopen64' since its mode is not important for this
     function.

     If the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a 32
     bits machine this function is available under the name 'freopen'
     and so transparently replaces the old interface.

   In some situations it is useful to know whether a given stream is
available for reading or writing.  This information is normally not
available and would have to be remembered separately.  Solaris
introduced a few functions to get this information from the stream
descriptor and these functions are also available in the GNU C Library.

 -- Function: int __freadable (FILE *STREAM)
     The '__freadable' function determines whether the stream STREAM was
     opened to allow reading.  In this case the return value is nonzero.
     For write-only streams the function returns zero.

     This function is declared in 'stdio_ext.h'.

 -- Function: int __fwritable (FILE *STREAM)
     The '__fwritable' function determines whether the stream STREAM was
     opened to allow writing.  In this case the return value is nonzero.
     For read-only streams the function returns zero.

     This function is declared in 'stdio_ext.h'.

   For slightly different kind of problems there are two more functions.
They provide even finer-grained information.

 -- Function: int __freading (FILE *STREAM)
     The '__freading' function determines whether the stream STREAM was
     last read from or whether it is opened read-only.  In this case the
     return value is nonzero, otherwise it is zero.  Determining whether
     a stream opened for reading and writing was last used for writing
     allows to draw conclusions about the content about the buffer,
     among other things.

     This function is declared in 'stdio_ext.h'.

 -- Function: int __fwriting (FILE *STREAM)
     The '__fwriting' function determines whether the stream STREAM was
     last written to or whether it is opened write-only.  In this case
     the return value is nonzero, otherwise it is zero.

     This function is declared in 'stdio_ext.h'.

12.4 Closing Streams
====================

When a stream is closed with 'fclose', the connection between the stream
and the file is canceled.  After you have closed a stream, you cannot
perform any additional operations on it.

 -- Function: int fclose (FILE *STREAM)
     This function causes STREAM to be closed and the connection to the
     corresponding file to be broken.  Any buffered output is written
     and any buffered input is discarded.  The 'fclose' function returns
     a value of '0' if the file was closed successfully, and 'EOF' if an
     error was detected.

     It is important to check for errors when you call 'fclose' to close
     an output stream, because real, everyday errors can be detected at
     this time.  For example, when 'fclose' writes the remaining
     buffered output, it might get an error because the disk is full.
     Even if you know the buffer is empty, errors can still occur when
     closing a file if you are using NFS.

     The function 'fclose' is declared in 'stdio.h'.

   To close all streams currently available the GNU C Library provides
another function.

 -- Function: int fcloseall (void)
     This function causes all open streams of the process to be closed
     and the connection to corresponding files to be broken.  All
     buffered data is written and any buffered input is discarded.  The
     'fcloseall' function returns a value of '0' if all the files were
     closed successfully, and 'EOF' if an error was detected.

     This function should be used only in special situations, e.g., when
     an error occurred and the program must be aborted.  Normally each
     single stream should be closed separately so that problems with
     individual streams can be identified.  It is also problematic since
     the standard streams (*note Standard Streams::) will also be
     closed.

     The function 'fcloseall' is declared in 'stdio.h'.

   If the 'main' function to your program returns, or if you call the
'exit' function (*note Normal Termination::), all open streams are
automatically closed properly.  If your program terminates in any other
manner, such as by calling the 'abort' function (*note Aborting a
Program::) or from a fatal signal (*note Signal Handling::), open
streams might not be closed properly.  Buffered output might not be
flushed and files may be incomplete.  For more information on buffering
of streams, see *note Stream Buffering::.

12.5 Streams and Threads
========================

Streams can be used in multi-threaded applications in the same way they
are used in single-threaded applications.  But the programmer must be
aware of the possible complications.  It is important to know about
these also if the program one writes never use threads since the design
and implementation of many stream functions is heavily influenced by the
requirements added by multi-threaded programming.

   The POSIX standard requires that by default the stream operations are
atomic.  I.e., issuing two stream operations for the same stream in two
threads at the same time will cause the operations to be executed as if
they were issued sequentially.  The buffer operations performed while
reading or writing are protected from other uses of the same stream.  To
do this each stream has an internal lock object which has to be
(implicitly) acquired before any work can be done.

   But there are situations where this is not enough and there are also
situations where this is not wanted.  The implicit locking is not enough
if the program requires more than one stream function call to happen
atomically.  One example would be if an output line a program wants to
generate is created by several function calls.  The functions by
themselves would ensure only atomicity of their own operation, but not
atomicity over all the function calls.  For this it is necessary to
perform the stream locking in the application code.

 -- Function: void flockfile (FILE *STREAM)
     The 'flockfile' function acquires the internal locking object
     associated with the stream STREAM.  This ensures that no other
     thread can explicitly through 'flockfile'/'ftrylockfile' or
     implicit through a call of a stream function lock the stream.  The
     thread will block until the lock is acquired.  An explicit call to
     'funlockfile' has to be used to release the lock.

 -- Function: int ftrylockfile (FILE *STREAM)
     The 'ftrylockfile' function tries to acquire the internal locking
     object associated with the stream STREAM just like 'flockfile'.
     But unlike 'flockfile' this function does not block if the lock is
     not available.  'ftrylockfile' returns zero if the lock was
     successfully acquired.  Otherwise the stream is locked by another
     thread.

 -- Function: void funlockfile (FILE *STREAM)
     The 'funlockfile' function releases the internal locking object of
     the stream STREAM.  The stream must have been locked before by a
     call to 'flockfile' or a successful call of 'ftrylockfile'.  The
     implicit locking performed by the stream operations do not count.
     The 'funlockfile' function does not return an error status and the
     behavior of a call for a stream which is not locked by the current
     thread is undefined.

   The following example shows how the functions above can be used to
generate an output line atomically even in multi-threaded applications
(yes, the same job could be done with one 'fprintf' call but it is
sometimes not possible):

     FILE *fp;
     {
        ...
        flockfile (fp);
        fputs ("This is test number ", fp);
        fprintf (fp, "%d\n", test);
        funlockfile (fp)
     }

   Without the explicit locking it would be possible for another thread
to use the stream FP after the 'fputs' call return and before 'fprintf'
was called with the result that the number does not follow the word
'number'.

   From this description it might already be clear that the locking
objects in streams are no simple mutexes.  Since locking the same stream
twice in the same thread is allowed the locking objects must be
equivalent to recursive mutexes.  These mutexes keep track of the owner
and the number of times the lock is acquired.  The same number of
'funlockfile' calls by the same threads is necessary to unlock the
stream completely.  For instance:

     void
     foo (FILE *fp)
     {
       ftrylockfile (fp);
       fputs ("in foo\n", fp);
       /* This is very wrong!!!  */
       funlockfile (fp);
     }

   It is important here that the 'funlockfile' function is only called
if the 'ftrylockfile' function succeeded in locking the stream.  It is
therefore always wrong to ignore the result of 'ftrylockfile'.  And it
makes no sense since otherwise one would use 'flockfile'.  The result of
code like that above is that either 'funlockfile' tries to free a stream
that hasn't been locked by the current thread or it frees the stream
prematurely.  The code should look like this:

     void
     foo (FILE *fp)
     {
       if (ftrylockfile (fp) == 0)
         {
           fputs ("in foo\n", fp);
           funlockfile (fp);
         }
     }

   Now that we covered why it is necessary to have these locking it is
necessary to talk about situations when locking is unwanted and what can
be done.  The locking operations (explicit or implicit) don't come for
free.  Even if a lock is not taken the cost is not zero.  The operations
which have to be performed require memory operations that are safe in
multi-processor environments.  With the many local caches involved in
such systems this is quite costly.  So it is best to avoid the locking
completely if it is not needed - because the code in question is never
used in a context where two or more threads may use a stream at a time.
This can be determined most of the time for application code; for
library code which can be used in many contexts one should default to be
conservative and use locking.

   There are two basic mechanisms to avoid locking.  The first is to use
the '_unlocked' variants of the stream operations.  The POSIX standard
defines quite a few of those and the GNU C Library adds a few more.
These variants of the functions behave just like the functions with the
name without the suffix except that they do not lock the stream.  Using
these functions is very desirable since they are potentially much
faster.  This is not only because the locking operation itself is
avoided.  More importantly, functions like 'putc' and 'getc' are very
simple and traditionally (before the introduction of threads) were
implemented as macros which are very fast if the buffer is not empty.
With the addition of locking requirements these functions are no longer
implemented as macros since they would expand to too much code.  But
these macros are still available with the same functionality under the
new names 'putc_unlocked' and 'getc_unlocked'.  This possibly huge
difference of speed also suggests the use of the '_unlocked' functions
even if locking is required.  The difference is that the locking then
has to be performed in the program:

     void
     foo (FILE *fp, char *buf)
     {
       flockfile (fp);
       while (*buf != '/')
         putc_unlocked (*buf++, fp);
       funlockfile (fp);
     }

   If in this example the 'putc' function would be used and the explicit
locking would be missing the 'putc' function would have to acquire the
lock in every call, potentially many times depending on when the loop
terminates.  Writing it the way illustrated above allows the
'putc_unlocked' macro to be used which means no locking and direct
manipulation of the buffer of the stream.

   A second way to avoid locking is by using a non-standard function
which was introduced in Solaris and is available in the GNU C Library as
well.

 -- Function: int __fsetlocking (FILE *STREAM, int TYPE)

     The '__fsetlocking' function can be used to select whether the
     stream operations will implicitly acquire the locking object of the
     stream STREAM.  By default this is done but it can be disabled and
     reinstated using this function.  There are three values defined for
     the TYPE parameter.

     'FSETLOCKING_INTERNAL'
          The stream 'stream' will from now on use the default internal
          locking.  Every stream operation with exception of the
          '_unlocked' variants will implicitly lock the stream.

     'FSETLOCKING_BYCALLER'
          After the '__fsetlocking' function returns the user is
          responsible for locking the stream.  None of the stream
          operations will implicitly do this anymore until the state is
          set back to 'FSETLOCKING_INTERNAL'.

     'FSETLOCKING_QUERY'
          '__fsetlocking' only queries the current locking state of the
          stream.  The return value will be 'FSETLOCKING_INTERNAL' or
          'FSETLOCKING_BYCALLER' depending on the state.

     The return value of '__fsetlocking' is either
     'FSETLOCKING_INTERNAL' or 'FSETLOCKING_BYCALLER' depending on the
     state of the stream before the call.

     This function and the values for the TYPE parameter are declared in
     'stdio_ext.h'.

   This function is especially useful when program code has to be used
which is written without knowledge about the '_unlocked' functions (or
if the programmer was too lazy to use them).

12.6 Streams in Internationalized Applications
==============================================

ISO C90 introduced the new type 'wchar_t' to allow handling larger
character sets.  What was missing was a possibility to output strings of
'wchar_t' directly.  One had to convert them into multibyte strings
using 'mbstowcs' (there was no 'mbsrtowcs' yet) and then use the normal
stream functions.  While this is doable it is very cumbersome since
performing the conversions is not trivial and greatly increases program
complexity and size.

   The Unix standard early on (I think in XPG4.2) introduced two
additional format specifiers for the 'printf' and 'scanf' families of
functions.  Printing and reading of single wide characters was made
possible using the '%C' specifier and wide character strings can be
handled with '%S'.  These modifiers behave just like '%c' and '%s' only
that they expect the corresponding argument to have the wide character
type and that the wide character and string are transformed into/from
multibyte strings before being used.

   This was a beginning but it is still not good enough.  Not always is
it desirable to use 'printf' and 'scanf'.  The other, smaller and faster
functions cannot handle wide characters.  Second, it is not possible to
have a format string for 'printf' and 'scanf' consisting of wide
characters.  The result is that format strings would have to be
generated if they have to contain non-basic characters.

   In the Amendment 1 to ISO C90 a whole new set of functions was added
to solve the problem.  Most of the stream functions got a counterpart
which take a wide character or wide character string instead of a
character or string respectively.  The new functions operate on the same
streams (like 'stdout').  This is different from the model of the C++
runtime library where separate streams for wide and normal I/O are used.

   Being able to use the same stream for wide and normal operations
comes with a restriction: a stream can be used either for wide
operations or for normal operations.  Once it is decided there is no way
back.  Only a call to 'freopen' or 'freopen64' can reset the
"orientation".  The orientation can be decided in three ways:

   * If any of the normal character functions is used (this includes the
     'fread' and 'fwrite' functions) the stream is marked as not wide
     oriented.

   * If any of the wide character functions is used the stream is marked
     as wide oriented.

   * The 'fwide' function can be used to set the orientation either way.

   It is important to never mix the use of wide and not wide operations
on a stream.  There are no diagnostics issued.  The application behavior
will simply be strange or the application will simply crash.  The
'fwide' function can help avoiding this.

 -- Function: int fwide (FILE *STREAM, int MODE)

     The 'fwide' function can be used to set and query the state of the
     orientation of the stream STREAM.  If the MODE parameter has a
     positive value the streams get wide oriented, for negative values
     narrow oriented.  It is not possible to overwrite previous
     orientations with 'fwide'.  I.e., if the stream STREAM was already
     oriented before the call nothing is done.

     If MODE is zero the current orientation state is queried and
     nothing is changed.

     The 'fwide' function returns a negative value, zero, or a positive
     value if the stream is narrow, not at all, or wide oriented
     respectively.

     This function was introduced in Amendment 1 to ISO C90 and is
     declared in 'wchar.h'.

   It is generally a good idea to orient a stream as early as possible.
This can prevent surprise especially for the standard streams 'stdin',
'stdout', and 'stderr'.  If some library function in some situations
uses one of these streams and this use orients the stream in a different
way the rest of the application expects it one might end up with hard to
reproduce errors.  Remember that no errors are signal if the streams are
used incorrectly.  Leaving a stream unoriented after creation is
normally only necessary for library functions which create streams which
can be used in different contexts.

   When writing code which uses streams and which can be used in
different contexts it is important to query the orientation of the
stream before using it (unless the rules of the library interface demand
a specific orientation).  The following little, silly function
illustrates this.

     void
     print_f (FILE *fp)
     {
       if (fwide (fp, 0) > 0)
         /* Positive return value means wide orientation.  */
         fputwc (L'f', fp);
       else
         fputc ('f', fp);
     }

   Note that in this case the function 'print_f' decides about the
orientation of the stream if it was unoriented before (will not happen
if the advise above is followed).

   The encoding used for the 'wchar_t' values is unspecified and the
user must not make any assumptions about it.  For I/O of 'wchar_t'
values this means that it is impossible to write these values directly
to the stream.  This is not what follows from the ISO C locale model
either.  What happens instead is that the bytes read from or written to
the underlying media are first converted into the internal encoding
chosen by the implementation for 'wchar_t'.  The external encoding is
determined by the 'LC_CTYPE' category of the current locale or by the
'ccs' part of the mode specification given to 'fopen', 'fopen64',
'freopen', or 'freopen64'.  How and when the conversion happens is
unspecified and it happens invisible to the user.

   Since a stream is created in the unoriented state it has at that
point no conversion associated with it.  The conversion which will be
used is determined by the 'LC_CTYPE' category selected at the time the
stream is oriented.  If the locales are changed at the runtime this
might produce surprising results unless one pays attention.  This is
just another good reason to orient the stream explicitly as soon as
possible, perhaps with a call to 'fwide'.

12.7 Simple Output by Characters or Lines
=========================================

This section describes functions for performing character- and
line-oriented output.

   These narrow streams functions are declared in the header file
'stdio.h' and the wide stream functions in 'wchar.h'.

 -- Function: int fputc (int C, FILE *STREAM)
     The 'fputc' function converts the character C to type 'unsigned
     char', and writes it to the stream STREAM.  'EOF' is returned if a
     write error occurs; otherwise the character C is returned.

 -- Function: wint_t fputwc (wchar_t WC, FILE *STREAM)
     The 'fputwc' function writes the wide character WC to the stream
     STREAM.  'WEOF' is returned if a write error occurs; otherwise the
     character WC is returned.

 -- Function: int fputc_unlocked (int C, FILE *STREAM)
     The 'fputc_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'fputc' function
     except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

 -- Function: wint_t fputwc_unlocked (wchar_t WC, FILE *STREAM)
     The 'fputwc_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'fputwc'
     function except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

     This function is a GNU extension.

 -- Function: int putc (int C, FILE *STREAM)
     This is just like 'fputc', except that most systems implement it as
     a macro, making it faster.  One consequence is that it may evaluate
     the STREAM argument more than once, which is an exception to the
     general rule for macros.  'putc' is usually the best function to
     use for writing a single character.

 -- Function: wint_t putwc (wchar_t WC, FILE *STREAM)
     This is just like 'fputwc', except that it can be implement as a
     macro, making it faster.  One consequence is that it may evaluate
     the STREAM argument more than once, which is an exception to the
     general rule for macros.  'putwc' is usually the best function to
     use for writing a single wide character.

 -- Function: int putc_unlocked (int C, FILE *STREAM)
     The 'putc_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'putc' function
     except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

 -- Function: wint_t putwc_unlocked (wchar_t WC, FILE *STREAM)
     The 'putwc_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'putwc' function
     except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

     This function is a GNU extension.

 -- Function: int putchar (int C)
     The 'putchar' function is equivalent to 'putc' with 'stdout' as the
     value of the STREAM argument.

 -- Function: wint_t putwchar (wchar_t WC)
     The 'putwchar' function is equivalent to 'putwc' with 'stdout' as
     the value of the STREAM argument.

 -- Function: int putchar_unlocked (int C)
     The 'putchar_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'putchar'
     function except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

 -- Function: wint_t putwchar_unlocked (wchar_t WC)
     The 'putwchar_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'putwchar'
     function except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

     This function is a GNU extension.

 -- Function: int fputs (const char *S, FILE *STREAM)
     The function 'fputs' writes the string S to the stream STREAM.  The
     terminating null character is not written.  This function does
     _not_ add a newline character, either.  It outputs only the
     characters in the string.

     This function returns 'EOF' if a write error occurs, and otherwise
     a non-negative value.

     For example:

          fputs ("Are ", stdout);
          fputs ("you ", stdout);
          fputs ("hungry?\n", stdout);

     outputs the text 'Are you hungry?' followed by a newline.

 -- Function: int fputws (const wchar_t *WS, FILE *STREAM)
     The function 'fputws' writes the wide character string WS to the
     stream STREAM.  The terminating null character is not written.
     This function does _not_ add a newline character, either.  It
     outputs only the characters in the string.

     This function returns 'WEOF' if a write error occurs, and otherwise
     a non-negative value.

 -- Function: int fputs_unlocked (const char *S, FILE *STREAM)
     The 'fputs_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'fputs' function
     except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

     This function is a GNU extension.

 -- Function: int fputws_unlocked (const wchar_t *WS, FILE *STREAM)
     The 'fputws_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'fputws'
     function except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

     This function is a GNU extension.

 -- Function: int puts (const char *S)
     The 'puts' function writes the string S to the stream 'stdout'
     followed by a newline.  The terminating null character of the
     string is not written.  (Note that 'fputs' does _not_ write a
     newline as this function does.)

     'puts' is the most convenient function for printing simple
     messages.  For example:

          puts ("This is a message.");

     outputs the text 'This is a message.' followed by a newline.

 -- Function: int putw (int W, FILE *STREAM)
     This function writes the word W (that is, an 'int') to STREAM.  It
     is provided for compatibility with SVID, but we recommend you use
     'fwrite' instead (*note Block Input/Output::).

12.8 Character Input
====================

This section describes functions for performing character-oriented
input.  These narrow streams functions are declared in the header file
'stdio.h' and the wide character functions are declared in 'wchar.h'.

   These functions return an 'int' or 'wint_t' value (for narrow and
wide stream functions respectively) that is either a character of input,
or the special value 'EOF'/'WEOF' (usually -1).  For the narrow stream
functions it is important to store the result of these functions in a
variable of type 'int' instead of 'char', even when you plan to use it
only as a character.  Storing 'EOF' in a 'char' variable truncates its
value to the size of a character, so that it is no longer
distinguishable from the valid character '(char) -1'.  So always use an
'int' for the result of 'getc' and friends, and check for 'EOF' after
the call; once you've verified that the result is not 'EOF', you can be
sure that it will fit in a 'char' variable without loss of information.

 -- Function: int fgetc (FILE *STREAM)
     This function reads the next character as an 'unsigned char' from
     the stream STREAM and returns its value, converted to an 'int'.  If
     an end-of-file condition or read error occurs, 'EOF' is returned
     instead.

 -- Function: wint_t fgetwc (FILE *STREAM)
     This function reads the next wide character from the stream STREAM
     and returns its value.  If an end-of-file condition or read error
     occurs, 'WEOF' is returned instead.

 -- Function: int fgetc_unlocked (FILE *STREAM)
     The 'fgetc_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'fgetc' function
     except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

 -- Function: wint_t fgetwc_unlocked (FILE *STREAM)
     The 'fgetwc_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'fgetwc'
     function except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

     This function is a GNU extension.

 -- Function: int getc (FILE *STREAM)
     This is just like 'fgetc', except that it is permissible (and
     typical) for it to be implemented as a macro that evaluates the
     STREAM argument more than once.  'getc' is often highly optimized,
     so it is usually the best function to use to read a single
     character.

 -- Function: wint_t getwc (FILE *STREAM)
     This is just like 'fgetwc', except that it is permissible for it to
     be implemented as a macro that evaluates the STREAM argument more
     than once.  'getwc' can be highly optimized, so it is usually the
     best function to use to read a single wide character.

 -- Function: int getc_unlocked (FILE *STREAM)
     The 'getc_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'getc' function
     except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

 -- Function: wint_t getwc_unlocked (FILE *STREAM)
     The 'getwc_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'getwc' function
     except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

     This function is a GNU extension.

 -- Function: int getchar (void)
     The 'getchar' function is equivalent to 'getc' with 'stdin' as the
     value of the STREAM argument.

 -- Function: wint_t getwchar (void)
     The 'getwchar' function is equivalent to 'getwc' with 'stdin' as
     the value of the STREAM argument.

 -- Function: int getchar_unlocked (void)
     The 'getchar_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'getchar'
     function except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

 -- Function: wint_t getwchar_unlocked (void)
     The 'getwchar_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'getwchar'
     function except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

     This function is a GNU extension.

   Here is an example of a function that does input using 'fgetc'.  It
would work just as well using 'getc' instead, or using 'getchar ()'
instead of 'fgetc (stdin)'.  The code would also work the same for the
wide character stream functions.

     int
     y_or_n_p (const char *question)
     {
       fputs (question, stdout);
       while (1)
         {
           int c, answer;
           /* Write a space to separate answer from question. */
           fputc (' ', stdout);
           /* Read the first character of the line.
	      This should be the answer character, but might not be. */
           c = tolower (fgetc (stdin));
           answer = c;
           /* Discard rest of input line. */
           while (c != '\n' && c != EOF)
     	c = fgetc (stdin);
           /* Obey the answer if it was valid. */
           if (answer == 'y')
     	return 1;
           if (answer == 'n')
     	return 0;
           /* Answer was invalid: ask for valid answer. */
           fputs ("Please answer y or n:", stdout);
         }
     }

 -- Function: int getw (FILE *STREAM)
     This function reads a word (that is, an 'int') from STREAM.  It's
     provided for compatibility with SVID. We recommend you use 'fread'
     instead (*note Block Input/Output::).  Unlike 'getc', any 'int'
     value could be a valid result.  'getw' returns 'EOF' when it
     encounters end-of-file or an error, but there is no way to
     distinguish this from an input word with value -1.


File: libc.info,  Node: Line Input,  Next: Unreading,  Prev: Character Input,  Up: I/O on Streams

12.9 Line-Oriented Input
========================

Since many programs interpret input on the basis of lines, it is
convenient to have functions to read a line of text from a stream.

   Standard C has functions to do this, but they aren't very safe: null
characters and even (for 'gets') long lines can confuse them.  So the
GNU C Library provides the nonstandard 'getline' function that makes it
easy to read lines reliably.

   Another GNU extension, 'getdelim', generalizes 'getline'.  It reads a
delimited record, defined as everything through the next occurrence of a
specified delimiter character.

   All these functions are declared in 'stdio.h'.

 -- Function: ssize_t getline (char **LINEPTR, size_t *N, FILE *STREAM)
     This function reads an entire line from STREAM, storing the text
     (including the newline and a terminating null character) in a
     buffer and storing the buffer address in '*LINEPTR'.

     Before calling 'getline', you should place in '*LINEPTR' the
     address of a buffer '*N' bytes long, allocated with 'malloc'.  If
     this buffer is long enough to hold the line, 'getline' stores the
     line in this buffer.  Otherwise, 'getline' makes the buffer bigger
     using 'realloc', storing the new buffer address back in '*LINEPTR'
     and the increased size back in '*N'.  *Note Unconstrained
     Allocation::.

     If you set '*LINEPTR' to a null pointer, and '*N' to zero, before
     the call, then 'getline' allocates the initial buffer for you by
     calling 'malloc'.

     In either case, when 'getline' returns, '*LINEPTR' is a 'char *'
     which points to the text of the line.

     When 'getline' is successful, it returns the number of characters
     read (including the newline, but not including the terminating
     null).  This value enables you to distinguish null characters that
     are part of the line from the null character inserted as a
     terminator.

     This function is a GNU extension, but it is the recommended way to
     read lines from a stream.  The alternative standard functions are
     unreliable.

     If an error occurs or end of file is reached without any bytes
     read, 'getline' returns '-1'.

 -- Function: ssize_t getdelim (char **LINEPTR, size_t *N, int
          DELIMITER, FILE *STREAM)
     This function is like 'getline' except that the character which
     tells it to stop reading is not necessarily newline.  The argument
     DELIMITER specifies the delimiter character; 'getdelim' keeps
     reading until it sees that character (or end of file).

     The text is stored in LINEPTR, including the delimiter character
     and a terminating null.  Like 'getline', 'getdelim' makes LINEPTR
     bigger if it isn't big enough.

     'getline' is in fact implemented in terms of 'getdelim', just like
     this:

          ssize_t
          getline (char **lineptr, size_t *n, FILE *stream)
          {
            return getdelim (lineptr, n, '\n', stream);
          }

 -- Function: char * fgets (char *S, int COUNT, FILE *STREAM)
     The 'fgets' function reads characters from the stream STREAM up to
     and including a newline character and stores them in the string S,
     adding a null character to mark the end of the string.  You must
     supply COUNT characters worth of space in S, but the number of
     characters read is at most COUNT - 1.  The extra character space is
     used to hold the null character at the end of the string.

     If the system is already at end of file when you call 'fgets', then
     the contents of the array S are unchanged and a null pointer is
     returned.  A null pointer is also returned if a read error occurs.
     Otherwise, the return value is the pointer S.

     *Warning:* If the input data has a null character, you can't tell.
     So don't use 'fgets' unless you know the data cannot contain a
     null.  Don't use it to read files edited by the user because, if
     the user inserts a null character, you should either handle it
     properly or print a clear error message.  We recommend using
     'getline' instead of 'fgets'.

 -- Function: wchar_t * fgetws (wchar_t *WS, int COUNT, FILE *STREAM)
     The 'fgetws' function reads wide characters from the stream STREAM
     up to and including a newline character and stores them in the
     string WS, adding a null wide character to mark the end of the
     string.  You must supply COUNT wide characters worth of space in
     WS, but the number of characters read is at most COUNT - 1.  The
     extra character space is used to hold the null wide character at
     the end of the string.

     If the system is already at end of file when you call 'fgetws',
     then the contents of the array WS are unchanged and a null pointer
     is returned.  A null pointer is also returned if a read error
     occurs.  Otherwise, the return value is the pointer WS.

     *Warning:* If the input data has a null wide character (which are
     null bytes in the input stream), you can't tell.  So don't use
     'fgetws' unless you know the data cannot contain a null.  Don't use
     it to read files edited by the user because, if the user inserts a
     null character, you should either handle it properly or print a
     clear error message.

 -- Function: char * fgets_unlocked (char *S, int COUNT, FILE *STREAM)
     The 'fgets_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'fgets' function
     except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

     This function is a GNU extension.

 -- Function: wchar_t * fgetws_unlocked (wchar_t *WS, int COUNT, FILE
          *STREAM)
     The 'fgetws_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'fgetws'
     function except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

     This function is a GNU extension.

 -- Deprecated function: char * gets (char *S)
     The function 'gets' reads characters from the stream 'stdin' up to
     the next newline character, and stores them in the string S.  The
     newline character is discarded (note that this differs from the
     behavior of 'fgets', which copies the newline character into the
     string).  If 'gets' encounters a read error or end-of-file, it
     returns a null pointer; otherwise it returns S.

     *Warning:* The 'gets' function is *very dangerous* because it
     provides no protection against overflowing the string S.  The GNU C
     Library includes it for compatibility only.  You should *always*
     use 'fgets' or 'getline' instead.  To remind you of this, the
     linker (if using GNU 'ld') will issue a warning whenever you use
     'gets'.

12.10 Unreading
===============

In parser programs it is often useful to examine the next character in
the input stream without removing it from the stream.  This is called
"peeking ahead" at the input because your program gets a glimpse of the
input it will read next.

   Using stream I/O, you can peek ahead at input by first reading it and
then "unreading" it (also called "pushing it back" on the stream).
Unreading a character makes it available to be input again from the
stream, by the next call to 'fgetc' or other input function on that
stream.

* Menu:

* Unreading Idea::              An explanation of unreading with pictures.
* How Unread::                  How to call 'ungetc' to do unreading.


File: libc.info,  Node: Unreading Idea,  Next: How Unread,  Up: Unreading

12.10.1 What Unreading Means
----------------------------

Here is a pictorial explanation of unreading.  Suppose you have a stream
reading a file that contains just six characters, the letters 'foobar'.
Suppose you have read three characters so far.  The situation looks like
this:

     f  o  o  b  a  r
     	 ^

so the next input character will be 'b'.

   If instead of reading 'b' you unread the letter 'o', you get a
situation like this:

     f  o  o  b  a  r
     	 |
           o--
           ^

so that the next input characters will be 'o' and 'b'.

   If you unread '9' instead of 'o', you get this situation:

     f  o  o  b  a  r
     	 |
           9--
           ^

so that the next input characters will be '9' and 'b'.


File: libc.info,  Node: How Unread,  Prev: Unreading Idea,  Up: Unreading

12.10.2 Using 'ungetc' To Do Unreading
--------------------------------------

The function to unread a character is called 'ungetc', because it
reverses the action of 'getc'.

 -- Function: int ungetc (int C, FILE *STREAM)
     The 'ungetc' function pushes back the character C onto the input
     stream STREAM.  So the next input from STREAM will read C before
     anything else.

     If C is 'EOF', 'ungetc' does nothing and just returns 'EOF'.  This
     lets you call 'ungetc' with the return value of 'getc' without
     needing to check for an error from 'getc'.

     The character that you push back doesn't have to be the same as the
     last character that was actually read from the stream.  In fact, it
     isn't necessary to actually read any characters from the stream
     before unreading them with 'ungetc'!  But that is a strange way to
     write a program; usually 'ungetc' is used only to unread a
     character that was just read from the same stream.  The GNU C
     Library supports this even on files opened in binary mode, but
     other systems might not.

     The GNU C Library only supports one character of pushback--in other
     words, it does not work to call 'ungetc' twice without doing input
     in between.  Other systems might let you push back multiple
     characters; then reading from the stream retrieves the characters
     in the reverse order that they were pushed.

     Pushing back characters doesn't alter the file; only the internal
     buffering for the stream is affected.  If a file positioning
     function (such as 'fseek', 'fseeko' or 'rewind'; *note File
     Positioning::) is called, any pending pushed-back characters are
     discarded.

     Unreading a character on a stream that is at end of file clears the
     end-of-file indicator for the stream, because it makes the
     character of input available.  After you read that character,
     trying to read again will encounter end of file.

 -- Function: wint_t ungetwc (wint_t WC, FILE *STREAM)
     The 'ungetwc' function behaves just like 'ungetc' just that it
     pushes back a wide character.

   Here is an example showing the use of 'getc' and 'ungetc' to skip
over whitespace characters.  When this function reaches a non-whitespace
character, it unreads that character to be seen again on the next read
operation on the stream.

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <ctype.h>

     void
     skip_whitespace (FILE *stream)
     {
       int c;
       do
         /* No need to check for 'EOF' because it is not
            'isspace', and 'ungetc' ignores 'EOF'.  */
         c = getc (stream);
       while (isspace (c));
       ungetc (c, stream);
     }

12.11 Block Input/Output
========================

This section describes how to do input and output operations on blocks
of data.  You can use these functions to read and write binary data, as
well as to read and write text in fixed-size blocks instead of by
characters or lines.

   Binary files are typically used to read and write blocks of data in
the same format as is used to represent the data in a running program.
In other words, arbitrary blocks of memory--not just character or string
objects--can be written to a binary file, and meaningfully read in again
by the same program.

   Storing data in binary form is often considerably more efficient than
using the formatted I/O functions.  Also, for floating-point numbers,
the binary form avoids possible loss of precision in the conversion
process.  On the other hand, binary files can't be examined or modified
easily using many standard file utilities (such as text editors), and
are not portable between different implementations of the language, or
different kinds of computers.

   These functions are declared in 'stdio.h'.

 -- Function: size_t fread (void *DATA, size_t SIZE, size_t COUNT, FILE
          *STREAM)
     This function reads up to COUNT objects of size SIZE into the array
     DATA, from the stream STREAM.  It returns the number of objects
     actually read, which might be less than COUNT if a read error
     occurs or the end of the file is reached.  This function returns a
     value of zero (and doesn't read anything) if either SIZE or COUNT
     is zero.

     If 'fread' encounters end of file in the middle of an object, it
     returns the number of complete objects read, and discards the
     partial object.  Therefore, the stream remains at the actual end of
     the file.

 -- Function: size_t fread_unlocked (void *DATA, size_t SIZE, size_t
          COUNT, FILE *STREAM)
     The 'fread_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'fread' function
     except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

     This function is a GNU extension.

 -- Function: size_t fwrite (const void *DATA, size_t SIZE, size_t
          COUNT, FILE *STREAM)
     This function writes up to COUNT objects of size SIZE from the
     array DATA, to the stream STREAM.  The return value is normally
     COUNT, if the call succeeds.  Any other value indicates some sort
     of error, such as running out of space.

 -- Function: size_t fwrite_unlocked (const void *DATA, size_t SIZE,
          size_t COUNT, FILE *STREAM)
     The 'fwrite_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'fwrite'
     function except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

     This function is a GNU extension.

12.12 Formatted Output
======================

The functions described in this section ('printf' and related functions)
provide a convenient way to perform formatted output.  You call 'printf'
with a "format string" or "template string" that specifies how to format
the values of the remaining arguments.

   Unless your program is a filter that specifically performs line- or
character-oriented processing, using 'printf' or one of the other
related functions described in this section is usually the easiest and
most concise way to perform output.  These functions are especially
useful for printing error messages, tables of data, and the like.

12.12.1 Formatted Output Basics
-------------------------------

The 'printf' function can be used to print any number of arguments.  The
template string argument you supply in a call provides information not
only about the number of additional arguments, but also about their
types and what style should be used for printing them.

   Ordinary characters in the template string are simply written to the
output stream as-is, while "conversion specifications" introduced by a
'%' character in the template cause subsequent arguments to be formatted
and written to the output stream.  For example,

     int pct = 37;
     char filename[] = "foo.txt";
     printf ("Processing of `%s' is %d%% finished.\nPlease be patient.\n",
     	filename, pct);

produces output like

     Processing of `foo.txt' is 37% finished.
     Please be patient.

   This example shows the use of the '%d' conversion to specify that an
'int' argument should be printed in decimal notation, the '%s'
conversion to specify printing of a string argument, and the '%%'
conversion to print a literal '%' character.

   There are also conversions for printing an integer argument as an
unsigned value in octal, decimal, or hexadecimal radix ('%o', '%u', or
'%x', respectively); or as a character value ('%c').

   Floating-point numbers can be printed in normal, fixed-point notation
using the '%f' conversion or in exponential notation using the '%e'
conversion.  The '%g' conversion uses either '%e' or '%f' format,
depending on what is more appropriate for the magnitude of the
particular number.

   You can control formatting more precisely by writing "modifiers"
between the '%' and the character that indicates which conversion to
apply.  These slightly alter the ordinary behavior of the conversion.
For example, most conversion specifications permit you to specify a
minimum field width and a flag indicating whether you want the result
left- or right-justified within the field.

   The specific flags and modifiers that are permitted and their
interpretation vary depending on the particular conversion.  They're all
described in more detail in the following sections.  Don't worry if this
all seems excessively complicated at first; you can almost always get
reasonable free-format output without using any of the modifiers at all.
The modifiers are mostly used to make the output look "prettier" in
tables.

12.12.2 Output Conversion Syntax
--------------------------------

This section provides details about the precise syntax of conversion
specifications that can appear in a 'printf' template string.

   Characters in the template string that are not part of a conversion
specification are printed as-is to the output stream.  Multibyte
character sequences (*note Character Set Handling::) are permitted in a
template string.

   The conversion specifications in a 'printf' template string have the
general form:

     % [ PARAM-NO $] FLAGS WIDTH [ . PRECISION ] TYPE CONVERSION

or

     % [ PARAM-NO $] FLAGS WIDTH . * [ PARAM-NO $] TYPE CONVERSION

   For example, in the conversion specifier '%-10.8ld', the '-' is a
flag, '10' specifies the field width, the precision is '8', the letter
'l' is a type modifier, and 'd' specifies the conversion style.  (This
particular type specifier says to print a 'long int' argument in decimal
notation, with a minimum of 8 digits left-justified in a field at least
10 characters wide.)

   In more detail, output conversion specifications consist of an
initial '%' character followed in sequence by:

   * An optional specification of the parameter used for this format.
     Normally the parameters to the 'printf' function are assigned to
     the formats in the order of appearance in the format string.  But
     in some situations (such as message translation) this is not
     desirable and this extension allows an explicit parameter to be
     specified.

     The PARAM-NO parts of the format must be integers in the range of 1
     to the maximum number of arguments present to the function call.
     Some implementations limit this number to a certainly upper bound.
     The exact limit can be retrieved by the following constant.

      -- Macro: NL_ARGMAX
          The value of 'NL_ARGMAX' is the maximum value allowed for the
          specification of an positional parameter in a 'printf' call.
          The actual value in effect at runtime can be retrieved by
          using 'sysconf' using the '_SC_NL_ARGMAX' parameter *note
          Sysconf Definition::.

          Some system have a quite low limit such as 9 for System V
          systems.  The GNU C Library has no real limit.

     If any of the formats has a specification for the parameter
     position all of them in the format string shall have one.
     Otherwise the behavior is undefined.

   * Zero or more "flag characters" that modify the normal behavior of
     the conversion specification.

   * An optional decimal integer specifying the "minimum field width".
     If the normal conversion produces fewer characters than this, the
     field is padded with spaces to the specified width.  This is a
     _minimum_ value; if the normal conversion produces more characters
     than this, the field is _not_ truncated.  Normally, the output is
     right-justified within the field.

     You can also specify a field width of '*'.  This means that the
     next argument in the argument list (before the actual value to be
     printed) is used as the field width.  The value must be an 'int'.
     If the value is negative, this means to set the '-' flag (see
     below) and to use the absolute value as the field width.

   * An optional "precision" to specify the number of digits to be
     written for the numeric conversions.  If the precision is
     specified, it consists of a period ('.') followed optionally by a
     decimal integer (which defaults to zero if omitted).

     You can also specify a precision of '*'.  This means that the next
     argument in the argument list (before the actual value to be
     printed) is used as the precision.  The value must be an 'int', and
     is ignored if it is negative.  If you specify '*' for both the
     field width and precision, the field width argument precedes the
     precision argument.  Other C library versions may not recognize
     this syntax.

   * An optional "type modifier character", which is used to specify the
     data type of the corresponding argument if it differs from the
     default type.  (For example, the integer conversions assume a type
     of 'int', but you can specify 'h', 'l', or 'L' for other integer
     types.)

   * A character that specifies the conversion to be applied.

   The exact options that are permitted and how they are interpreted
vary between the different conversion specifiers.  See the descriptions
of the individual conversions for information about the particular
options that they use.

   With the '-Wformat' option, the GNU C compiler checks calls to
'printf' and related functions.  It examines the format string and
verifies that the correct number and types of arguments are supplied.
There is also a GNU C syntax to tell the compiler that a function you
write uses a 'printf'-style format string.  *Note Declaring Attributes
of Functions: (gcc.info)Function Attributes, for more information.

12.12.3 Table of Output Conversions
-----------------------------------

Here is a table summarizing what all the different conversions do:

'%d', '%i'
     Print an integer as a signed decimal number.  *Note Integer
     Conversions::, for details.  '%d' and '%i' are synonymous for
     output, but are different when used with 'scanf' for input (*note
     Table of Input Conversions::).

'%o'
     Print an integer as an unsigned octal number.  *Note Integer
     Conversions::, for details.

'%u'
     Print an integer as an unsigned decimal number.  *Note Integer
     Conversions::, for details.

'%x', '%X'
     Print an integer as an unsigned hexadecimal number.  '%x' uses
     lower-case letters and '%X' uses upper-case.  *Note Integer
     Conversions::, for details.

'%f'
     Print a floating-point number in normal (fixed-point) notation.
     *Note Floating-Point Conversions::, for details.

'%e', '%E'
     Print a floating-point number in exponential notation.  '%e' uses
     lower-case letters and '%E' uses upper-case.  *Note Floating-Point
     Conversions::, for details.

'%g', '%G'
     Print a floating-point number in either normal or exponential
     notation, whichever is more appropriate for its magnitude.  '%g'
     uses lower-case letters and '%G' uses upper-case.  *Note
     Floating-Point Conversions::, for details.

'%a', '%A'
     Print a floating-point number in a hexadecimal fractional notation
     which the exponent to base 2 represented in decimal digits.  '%a'
     uses lower-case letters and '%A' uses upper-case.  *Note
     Floating-Point Conversions::, for details.

'%c'
     Print a single character.  *Note Other Output Conversions::.

'%C'
     This is an alias for '%lc' which is supported for compatibility
     with the Unix standard.

'%s'
     Print a string.  *Note Other Output Conversions::.

'%S'
     This is an alias for '%ls' which is supported for compatibility
     with the Unix standard.

'%p'
     Print the value of a pointer.  *Note Other Output Conversions::.

'%n'
     Get the number of characters printed so far.  *Note Other Output
     Conversions::.  Note that this conversion specification never
     produces any output.

'%m'
     Print the string corresponding to the value of 'errno'.  (This is a
     GNU extension.)  *Note Other Output Conversions::.

'%%'
     Print a literal '%' character.  *Note Other Output Conversions::.

   If the syntax of a conversion specification is invalid, unpredictable
things will happen, so don't do this.  If there aren't enough function
arguments provided to supply values for all the conversion
specifications in the template string, or if the arguments are not of
the correct types, the results are unpredictable.  If you supply more
arguments than conversion specifications, the extra argument values are
simply ignored; this is sometimes useful.

12.12.4 Integer Conversions
---------------------------

This section describes the options for the '%d', '%i', '%o', '%u', '%x',
and '%X' conversion specifications.  These conversions print integers in
various formats.

   The '%d' and '%i' conversion specifications both print an 'int'
argument as a signed decimal number; while '%o', '%u', and '%x' print
the argument as an unsigned octal, decimal, or hexadecimal number
(respectively).  The '%X' conversion specification is just like '%x'
except that it uses the characters 'ABCDEF' as digits instead of
'abcdef'.

   The following flags are meaningful:

'-'
     Left-justify the result in the field (instead of the normal
     right-justification).

'+'
     For the signed '%d' and '%i' conversions, print a plus sign if the
     value is positive.

' '
     For the signed '%d' and '%i' conversions, if the result doesn't
     start with a plus or minus sign, prefix it with a space character
     instead.  Since the '+' flag ensures that the result includes a
     sign, this flag is ignored if you supply both of them.

'#'
     For the '%o' conversion, this forces the leading digit to be '0',
     as if by increasing the precision.  For '%x' or '%X', this prefixes
     a leading '0x' or '0X' (respectively) to the result.  This doesn't
     do anything useful for the '%d', '%i', or '%u' conversions.  Using
     this flag produces output which can be parsed by the 'strtoul'
     function (*note Parsing of Integers::) and 'scanf' with the '%i'
     conversion (*note Numeric Input Conversions::).

'''
     Separate the digits into groups as specified by the locale
     specified for the 'LC_NUMERIC' category; *note General Numeric::.
     This flag is a GNU extension.

'0'
     Pad the field with zeros instead of spaces.  The zeros are placed
     after any indication of sign or base.  This flag is ignored if the
     '-' flag is also specified, or if a precision is specified.

   If a precision is supplied, it specifies the minimum number of digits
to appear; leading zeros are produced if necessary.  If you don't
specify a precision, the number is printed with as many digits as it
needs.  If you convert a value of zero with an explicit precision of
zero, then no characters at all are produced.

   Without a type modifier, the corresponding argument is treated as an
'int' (for the signed conversions '%i' and '%d') or 'unsigned int' (for
the unsigned conversions '%o', '%u', '%x', and '%X').  Recall that since
'printf' and friends are variadic, any 'char' and 'short' arguments are
automatically converted to 'int' by the default argument promotions.
For arguments of other integer types, you can use these modifiers:

'hh'
     Specifies that the argument is a 'signed char' or 'unsigned char',
     as appropriate.  A 'char' argument is converted to an 'int' or
     'unsigned int' by the default argument promotions anyway, but the
     'h' modifier says to convert it back to a 'char' again.

     This modifier was introduced in ISO C99.

'h'
     Specifies that the argument is a 'short int' or 'unsigned short
     int', as appropriate.  A 'short' argument is converted to an 'int'
     or 'unsigned int' by the default argument promotions anyway, but
     the 'h' modifier says to convert it back to a 'short' again.

'j'
     Specifies that the argument is a 'intmax_t' or 'uintmax_t', as
     appropriate.

     This modifier was introduced in ISO C99.

'l'
     Specifies that the argument is a 'long int' or 'unsigned long int',
     as appropriate.  Two 'l' characters is like the 'L' modifier,
     below.

     If used with '%c' or '%s' the corresponding parameter is considered
     as a wide character or wide character string respectively.  This
     use of 'l' was introduced in Amendment 1 to ISO C90.

'L'
'll'
'q'
     Specifies that the argument is a 'long long int'.  (This type is an
     extension supported by the GNU C compiler.  On systems that don't
     support extra-long integers, this is the same as 'long int'.)

     The 'q' modifier is another name for the same thing, which comes
     from 4.4 BSD; a 'long long int' is sometimes called a "quad" 'int'.

't'
     Specifies that the argument is a 'ptrdiff_t'.

     This modifier was introduced in ISO C99.

'z'
'Z'
     Specifies that the argument is a 'size_t'.

     'z' was introduced in ISO C99.  'Z' is a GNU extension predating
     this addition and should not be used in new code.

   Here is an example.  Using the template string:

     "|%5d|%-5d|%+5d|%+-5d|% 5d|%05d|%5.0d|%5.2d|%d|\n"

to print numbers using the different options for the '%d' conversion
gives results like:

     |    0|0    |   +0|+0   |    0|00000|     |   00|0|
     |    1|1    |   +1|+1   |    1|00001|    1|   01|1|
     |   -1|-1   |   -1|-1   |   -1|-0001|   -1|  -01|-1|
     |100000|100000|+100000|+100000| 100000|100000|100000|100000|100000|

   In particular, notice what happens in the last case where the number
is too large to fit in the minimum field width specified.

   Here are some more examples showing how unsigned integers print under
various format options, using the template string:

     "|%5u|%5o|%5x|%5X|%#5o|%#5x|%#5X|%#10.8x|\n"

     |    0|    0|    0|    0|    0|    0|    0|  00000000|
     |    1|    1|    1|    1|   01|  0x1|  0X1|0x00000001|
     |100000|303240|186a0|186A0|0303240|0x186a0|0X186A0|0x000186a0|

12.12.5 Floating-Point Conversions
----------------------------------

This section discusses the conversion specifications for floating-point
numbers: the '%f', '%e', '%E', '%g', and '%G' conversions.

   The '%f' conversion prints its argument in fixed-point notation,
producing output of the form ['-']DDD'.'DDD, where the number of digits
following the decimal point is controlled by the precision you specify.

   The '%e' conversion prints its argument in exponential notation,
producing output of the form ['-']D'.'DDD'e'['+'|'-']DD.  Again, the
number of digits following the decimal point is controlled by the
precision.  The exponent always contains at least two digits.  The '%E'
conversion is similar but the exponent is marked with the letter 'E'
instead of 'e'.

   The '%g' and '%G' conversions print the argument in the style of '%e'
or '%E' (respectively) if the exponent would be less than -4 or greater
than or equal to the precision; otherwise they use the '%f' style.  A
precision of '0', is taken as 1.  Trailing zeros are removed from the
fractional portion of the result and a decimal-point character appears
only if it is followed by a digit.

   The '%a' and '%A' conversions are meant for representing
floating-point numbers exactly in textual form so that they can be
exchanged as texts between different programs and/or machines.  The
numbers are represented is the form ['-']'0x'H'.'HHH'p'['+'|'-']DD.  At
the left of the decimal-point character exactly one digit is print.
This character is only '0' if the number is denormalized.  Otherwise the
value is unspecified; it is implementation dependent how many bits are
used.  The number of hexadecimal digits on the right side of the
decimal-point character is equal to the precision.  If the precision is
zero it is determined to be large enough to provide an exact
representation of the number (or it is large enough to distinguish two
adjacent values if the 'FLT_RADIX' is not a power of 2, *note Floating
Point Parameters::).  For the '%a' conversion lower-case characters are
used to represent the hexadecimal number and the prefix and exponent
sign are printed as '0x' and 'p' respectively.  Otherwise upper-case
characters are used and '0X' and 'P' are used for the representation of
prefix and exponent string.  The exponent to the base of two is printed
as a decimal number using at least one digit but at most as many digits
as necessary to represent the value exactly.

   If the value to be printed represents infinity or a NaN, the output
is ['-']'inf' or 'nan' respectively if the conversion specifier is '%a',
'%e', '%f', or '%g' and it is ['-']'INF' or 'NAN' respectively if the
conversion is '%A', '%E', or '%G'.

   The following flags can be used to modify the behavior:

'-'
     Left-justify the result in the field.  Normally the result is
     right-justified.

'+'
     Always include a plus or minus sign in the result.

' '
     If the result doesn't start with a plus or minus sign, prefix it
     with a space instead.  Since the '+' flag ensures that the result
     includes a sign, this flag is ignored if you supply both of them.

'#'
     Specifies that the result should always include a decimal point,
     even if no digits follow it.  For the '%g' and '%G' conversions,
     this also forces trailing zeros after the decimal point to be left
     in place where they would otherwise be removed.

'''
     Separate the digits of the integer part of the result into groups
     as specified by the locale specified for the 'LC_NUMERIC' category;
     *note General Numeric::.  This flag is a GNU extension.

'0'
     Pad the field with zeros instead of spaces; the zeros are placed
     after any sign.  This flag is ignored if the '-' flag is also
     specified.

   The precision specifies how many digits follow the decimal-point
character for the '%f', '%e', and '%E' conversions.  For these
conversions, the default precision is '6'.  If the precision is
explicitly '0', this suppresses the decimal point character entirely.
For the '%g' and '%G' conversions, the precision specifies how many
significant digits to print.  Significant digits are the first digit
before the decimal point, and all the digits after it.  If the precision
is '0' or not specified for '%g' or '%G', it is treated like a value of
'1'.  If the value being printed cannot be expressed accurately in the
specified number of digits, the value is rounded to the nearest number
that fits.

   Without a type modifier, the floating-point conversions use an
argument of type 'double'.  (By the default argument promotions, any
'float' arguments are automatically converted to 'double'.)  The
following type modifier is supported:

'L'
     An uppercase 'L' specifies that the argument is a 'long double'.

   Here are some examples showing how numbers print using the various
floating-point conversions.  All of the numbers were printed using this
template string:

     "|%13.4a|%13.4f|%13.4e|%13.4g|\n"

   Here is the output:

     |  0x0.0000p+0|       0.0000|   0.0000e+00|            0|
     |  0x1.0000p-1|       0.5000|   5.0000e-01|          0.5|
     |  0x1.0000p+0|       1.0000|   1.0000e+00|            1|
     | -0x1.0000p+0|      -1.0000|  -1.0000e+00|           -1|
     |  0x1.9000p+6|     100.0000|   1.0000e+02|          100|
     |  0x1.f400p+9|    1000.0000|   1.0000e+03|         1000|
     | 0x1.3880p+13|   10000.0000|   1.0000e+04|        1e+04|
     | 0x1.81c8p+13|   12345.0000|   1.2345e+04|    1.234e+04|
     | 0x1.86a0p+16|  100000.0000|   1.0000e+05|        1e+05|
     | 0x1.e240p+16|  123456.0000|   1.2346e+05|    1.235e+05|

   Notice how the '%g' conversion drops trailing zeros.

12.12.6 Other Output Conversions
--------------------------------

This section describes miscellaneous conversions for 'printf'.

   The '%c' conversion prints a single character.  In case there is no
'l' modifier the 'int' argument is first converted to an 'unsigned
char'.  Then, if used in a wide stream function, the character is
converted into the corresponding wide character.  The '-' flag can be
used to specify left-justification in the field, but no other flags are
defined, and no precision or type modifier can be given.  For example:

     printf ("%c%c%c%c%c", 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o');

prints 'hello'.

   If there is a 'l' modifier present the argument is expected to be of
type 'wint_t'.  If used in a multibyte function the wide character is
converted into a multibyte character before being added to the output.
In this case more than one output byte can be produced.

   The '%s' conversion prints a string.  If no 'l' modifier is present
the corresponding argument must be of type 'char *' (or 'const char *').
If used in a wide stream function the string is first converted in a
wide character string.  A precision can be specified to indicate the
maximum number of characters to write; otherwise characters in the
string up to but not including the terminating null character are
written to the output stream.  The '-' flag can be used to specify
left-justification in the field, but no other flags or type modifiers
are defined for this conversion.  For example:

     printf ("%3s%-6s", "no", "where");

prints ' nowhere '.

   If there is a 'l' modifier present the argument is expected to be of
type 'wchar_t' (or 'const wchar_t *').

   If you accidentally pass a null pointer as the argument for a '%s'
conversion, the GNU C Library prints it as '(null)'.  We think this is
more useful than crashing.  But it's not good practice to pass a null
argument intentionally.

   The '%m' conversion prints the string corresponding to the error code
in 'errno'.  *Note Error Messages::.  Thus:

     fprintf (stderr, "can't open `%s': %m\n", filename);

is equivalent to:

     fprintf (stderr, "can't open `%s': %s\n", filename, strerror (errno));

The '%m' conversion is a GNU C Library extension.

   The '%p' conversion prints a pointer value.  The corresponding
argument must be of type 'void *'.  In practice, you can use any type of
pointer.

   In the GNU C Library, non-null pointers are printed as unsigned
integers, as if a '%#x' conversion were used.  Null pointers print as
'(nil)'.  (Pointers might print differently in other systems.)

   For example:

     printf ("%p", "testing");

prints '0x' followed by a hexadecimal number--the address of the string
constant '"testing"'.  It does not print the word 'testing'.

   You can supply the '-' flag with the '%p' conversion to specify
left-justification, but no other flags, precision, or type modifiers are
defined.

   The '%n' conversion is unlike any of the other output conversions.
It uses an argument which must be a pointer to an 'int', but instead of
printing anything it stores the number of characters printed so far by
this call at that location.  The 'h' and 'l' type modifiers are
permitted to specify that the argument is of type 'short int *' or 'long
int *' instead of 'int *', but no flags, field width, or precision are
permitted.

   For example,

     int nchar;
     printf ("%d %s%n\n", 3, "bears", &nchar);

prints:

     3 bears

and sets 'nchar' to '7', because '3 bears' is seven characters.

   The '%%' conversion prints a literal '%' character.  This conversion
doesn't use an argument, and no flags, field width, precision, or type
modifiers are permitted.

12.12.7 Formatted Output Functions
----------------------------------

This section describes how to call 'printf' and related functions.
Prototypes for these functions are in the header file 'stdio.h'.
Because these functions take a variable number of arguments, you _must_
declare prototypes for them before using them.  Of course, the easiest
way to make sure you have all the right prototypes is to just include
'stdio.h'.

 -- Function: int printf (const char *TEMPLATE, ...)
     The 'printf' function prints the optional arguments under the
     control of the template string TEMPLATE to the stream 'stdout'.  It
     returns the number of characters printed, or a negative value if
     there was an output error.

 -- Function: int wprintf (const wchar_t *TEMPLATE, ...)
     The 'wprintf' function prints the optional arguments under the
     control of the wide template string TEMPLATE to the stream
     'stdout'.  It returns the number of wide characters printed, or a
     negative value if there was an output error.

 -- Function: int fprintf (FILE *STREAM, const char *TEMPLATE, ...)
     This function is just like 'printf', except that the output is
     written to the stream STREAM instead of 'stdout'.

 -- Function: int fwprintf (FILE *STREAM, const wchar_t *TEMPLATE, ...)
     This function is just like 'wprintf', except that the output is
     written to the stream STREAM instead of 'stdout'.

 -- Function: int sprintf (char *S, const char *TEMPLATE, ...)
     This is like 'printf', except that the output is stored in the
     character array S instead of written to a stream.  A null character
     is written to mark the end of the string.

     The 'sprintf' function returns the number of characters stored in
     the array S, not including the terminating null character.

     The behavior of this function is undefined if copying takes place
     between objects that overlap--for example, if S is also given as an
     argument to be printed under control of the '%s' conversion.  *Note
     Copying and Concatenation::.

     *Warning:* The 'sprintf' function can be *dangerous* because it can
     potentially output more characters than can fit in the allocation
     size of the string S.  Remember that the field width given in a
     conversion specification is only a _minimum_ value.

     To avoid this problem, you can use 'snprintf' or 'asprintf',
     described below.

 -- Function: int swprintf (wchar_t *S, size_t SIZE, const wchar_t
          *TEMPLATE, ...)
     This is like 'wprintf', except that the output is stored in the
     wide character array WS instead of written to a stream.  A null
     wide character is written to mark the end of the string.  The SIZE
     argument specifies the maximum number of characters to produce.
     The trailing null character is counted towards this limit, so you
     should allocate at least SIZE wide characters for the string WS.

     The return value is the number of characters generated for the
     given input, excluding the trailing null.  If not all output fits
     into the provided buffer a negative value is returned.  You should
     try again with a bigger output string.  _Note:_ this is different
     from how 'snprintf' handles this situation.

     Note that the corresponding narrow stream function takes fewer
     parameters.  'swprintf' in fact corresponds to the 'snprintf'
     function.  Since the 'sprintf' function can be dangerous and should
     be avoided the ISO C committee refused to make the same mistake
     again and decided to not define an function exactly corresponding
     to 'sprintf'.

 -- Function: int snprintf (char *S, size_t SIZE, const char *TEMPLATE,
          ...)
     The 'snprintf' function is similar to 'sprintf', except that the
     SIZE argument specifies the maximum number of characters to
     produce.  The trailing null character is counted towards this
     limit, so you should allocate at least SIZE characters for the
     string S.  If SIZE is zero, nothing, not even the null byte, shall
     be written and S may be a null pointer.

     The return value is the number of characters which would be
     generated for the given input, excluding the trailing null.  If
     this value is greater or equal to SIZE, not all characters from the
     result have been stored in S.  You should try again with a bigger
     output string.  Here is an example of doing this:

          /* Construct a message describing the value of a variable
             whose name is NAME and whose value is VALUE. */
          char *
          make_message (char *name, char *value)
          {
            /* Guess we need no more than 100 chars of space. */
            int size = 100;
            char *buffer = (char *) xmalloc (size);
            int nchars;
            if (buffer == NULL)
              return NULL;

           /* Try to print in the allocated space. */
            nchars = snprintf (buffer, size, "value of %s is %s",
          		     name, value);
            if (nchars >= size)
              {
                /* Reallocate buffer now that we know
          	 how much space is needed. */
                size = nchars + 1;
                buffer = (char *) xrealloc (buffer, size);

                if (buffer != NULL)
          	/* Try again. */
          	snprintf (buffer, size, "value of %s is %s",
          		  name, value);
              }
            /* The last call worked, return the string. */
            return buffer;
          }

     In practice, it is often easier just to use 'asprintf', below.

     *Attention:* In versions of the GNU C Library prior to 2.1 the
     return value is the number of characters stored, not including the
     terminating null; unless there was not enough space in S to store
     the result in which case '-1' is returned.  This was changed in
     order to comply with the ISO C99 standard.

12.12.8 Dynamically Allocating Formatted Output
-----------------------------------------------

The functions in this section do formatted output and place the results
in dynamically allocated memory.

 -- Function: int asprintf (char **PTR, const char *TEMPLATE, ...)
     This function is similar to 'sprintf', except that it dynamically
     allocates a string (as with 'malloc'; *note Unconstrained
     Allocation::) to hold the output, instead of putting the output in
     a buffer you allocate in advance.  The PTR argument should be the
     address of a 'char *' object, and a successful call to 'asprintf'
     stores a pointer to the newly allocated string at that location.

     The return value is the number of characters allocated for the
     buffer, or less than zero if an error occurred.  Usually this means
     that the buffer could not be allocated.

     Here is how to use 'asprintf' to get the same result as the
     'snprintf' example, but more easily:

          /* Construct a message describing the value of a variable
             whose name is NAME and whose value is VALUE. */
          char *
          make_message (char *name, char *value)
          {
            char *result;
            if (asprintf (&result, "value of %s is %s", name, value) < 0)
              return NULL;
            return result;
          }

 -- Function: int obstack_printf (struct obstack *OBSTACK, const char
          *TEMPLATE, ...)
     This function is similar to 'asprintf', except that it uses the
     obstack OBSTACK to allocate the space.  *Note Obstacks::.

     The characters are written onto the end of the current object.  To
     get at them, you must finish the object with 'obstack_finish'
     (*note Growing Objects::).


File: libc.info,  Node: Variable Arguments Output,  Next: Parsing a Template String,  Prev: Dynamic Output,  Up: Formatted Output

12.12.9 Variable Arguments Output Functions
-------------------------------------------

The functions 'vprintf' and friends are provided so that you can define
your own variadic 'printf'-like functions that make use of the same
internals as the built-in formatted output functions.

   The most natural way to define such functions would be to use a
language construct to say, "Call 'printf' and pass this template plus
all of my arguments after the first five."  But there is no way to do
this in C, and it would be hard to provide a way, since at the C
language level there is no way to tell how many arguments your function
received.

   Since that method is impossible, we provide alternative functions,
the 'vprintf' series, which lets you pass a 'va_list' to describe "all
of my arguments after the first five."

   When it is sufficient to define a macro rather than a real function,
the GNU C compiler provides a way to do this much more easily with
macros.  For example:

     #define myprintf(a, b, c, d, e, rest...) \
     	    printf (mytemplate , ## rest)

*Note (cpp)Variadic Macros::, for details.  But this is limited to
macros, and does not apply to real functions at all.

   Before calling 'vprintf' or the other functions listed in this
section, you _must_ call 'va_start' (*note Variadic Functions::) to
initialize a pointer to the variable arguments.  Then you can call
'va_arg' to fetch the arguments that you want to handle yourself.  This
advances the pointer past those arguments.

   Once your 'va_list' pointer is pointing at the argument of your
choice, you are ready to call 'vprintf'.  That argument and all
subsequent arguments that were passed to your function are used by
'vprintf' along with the template that you specified separately.

   In some other systems, the 'va_list' pointer may become invalid after
the call to 'vprintf', so you must not use 'va_arg' after you call
'vprintf'.  Instead, you should call 'va_end' to retire the pointer from
service.  However, you can safely call 'va_start' on another pointer
variable and begin fetching the arguments again through that pointer.
Calling 'vprintf' does not destroy the argument list of your function,
merely the particular pointer that you passed to it.

   GNU C does not have such restrictions.  You can safely continue to
fetch arguments from a 'va_list' pointer after passing it to 'vprintf',
and 'va_end' is a no-op.  (Note, however, that subsequent 'va_arg' calls
will fetch the same arguments which 'vprintf' previously used.)

   Prototypes for these functions are declared in 'stdio.h'.

 -- Function: int vprintf (const char *TEMPLATE, va_list AP)
     This function is similar to 'printf' except that, instead of taking
     a variable number of arguments directly, it takes an argument list
     pointer AP.

 -- Function: int vwprintf (const wchar_t *TEMPLATE, va_list AP)
     This function is similar to 'wprintf' except that, instead of
     taking a variable number of arguments directly, it takes an
     argument list pointer AP.

 -- Function: int vfprintf (FILE *STREAM, const char *TEMPLATE, va_list
          AP)
     This is the equivalent of 'fprintf' with the variable argument list
     specified directly as for 'vprintf'.

 -- Function: int vfwprintf (FILE *STREAM, const wchar_t *TEMPLATE,
          va_list AP)
     This is the equivalent of 'fwprintf' with the variable argument
     list specified directly as for 'vwprintf'.

 -- Function: int vsprintf (char *S, const char *TEMPLATE, va_list AP)
     This is the equivalent of 'sprintf' with the variable argument list
     specified directly as for 'vprintf'.

 -- Function: int vswprintf (wchar_t *S, size_t SIZE, const wchar_t
          *TEMPLATE, va_list AP)
     This is the equivalent of 'swprintf' with the variable argument
     list specified directly as for 'vwprintf'.

 -- Function: int vsnprintf (char *S, size_t SIZE, const char *TEMPLATE,
          va_list AP)
     This is the equivalent of 'snprintf' with the variable argument
     list specified directly as for 'vprintf'.

 -- Function: int vasprintf (char **PTR, const char *TEMPLATE, va_list
          AP)
     The 'vasprintf' function is the equivalent of 'asprintf' with the
     variable argument list specified directly as for 'vprintf'.

 -- Function: int obstack_vprintf (struct obstack *OBSTACK, const char
          *TEMPLATE, va_list AP)
     The 'obstack_vprintf' function is the equivalent of
     'obstack_printf' with the variable argument list specified directly
     as for 'vprintf'.

   Here's an example showing how you might use 'vfprintf'.  This is a
function that prints error messages to the stream 'stderr', along with a
prefix indicating the name of the program (*note Error Messages::, for a
description of 'program_invocation_short_name').

     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdarg.h>

     void
     eprintf (const char *template, ...)
     {
       va_list ap;
       extern char *program_invocation_short_name;

       fprintf (stderr, "%s: ", program_invocation_short_name);
       va_start (ap, template);
       vfprintf (stderr, template, ap);
       va_end (ap);
     }

You could call 'eprintf' like this:

     eprintf ("file `%s' does not exist\n", filename);

   In GNU C, there is a special construct you can use to let the
compiler know that a function uses a 'printf'-style format string.  Then
it can check the number and types of arguments in each call to the
function, and warn you when they do not match the format string.  For
example, take this declaration of 'eprintf':

     void eprintf (const char *template, ...)
     	__attribute__ ((format (printf, 1, 2)));

This tells the compiler that 'eprintf' uses a format string like
'printf' (as opposed to 'scanf'; *note Formatted Input::); the format
string appears as the first argument; and the arguments to satisfy the
format begin with the second.  *Note Declaring Attributes of Functions:
(gcc.info)Function Attributes, for more information.

12.12.10 Parsing a Template String
----------------------------------

You can use the function 'parse_printf_format' to obtain information
about the number and types of arguments that are expected by a given
template string.  This function permits interpreters that provide
interfaces to 'printf' to avoid passing along invalid arguments from the
user's program, which could cause a crash.

   All the symbols described in this section are declared in the header
file 'printf.h'.

 -- Function: size_t parse_printf_format (const char *TEMPLATE, size_t
          N, int *ARGTYPES)
     This function returns information about the number and types of
     arguments expected by the 'printf' template string TEMPLATE.  The
     information is stored in the array ARGTYPES; each element of this
     array describes one argument.  This information is encoded using
     the various 'PA_' macros, listed below.

     The argument N specifies the number of elements in the array
     ARGTYPES.  This is the maximum number of elements that
     'parse_printf_format' will try to write.

     'parse_printf_format' returns the total number of arguments
     required by TEMPLATE.  If this number is greater than N, then the
     information returned describes only the first N arguments.  If you
     want information about additional arguments, allocate a bigger
     array and call 'parse_printf_format' again.

   The argument types are encoded as a combination of a basic type and
modifier flag bits.

 -- Macro: int PA_FLAG_MASK
     This macro is a bitmask for the type modifier flag bits.  You can
     write the expression '(argtypes[i] & PA_FLAG_MASK)' to extract just
     the flag bits for an argument, or '(argtypes[i] & ~PA_FLAG_MASK)'
     to extract just the basic type code.

   Here are symbolic constants that represent the basic types; they
stand for integer values.

'PA_INT'
     This specifies that the base type is 'int'.

'PA_CHAR'
     This specifies that the base type is 'int', cast to 'char'.

'PA_STRING'
     This specifies that the base type is 'char *', a null-terminated
     string.

'PA_POINTER'
     This specifies that the base type is 'void *', an arbitrary
     pointer.

'PA_FLOAT'
     This specifies that the base type is 'float'.

'PA_DOUBLE'
     This specifies that the base type is 'double'.

'PA_LAST'
     You can define additional base types for your own programs as
     offsets from 'PA_LAST'.  For example, if you have data types 'foo'
     and 'bar' with their own specialized 'printf' conversions, you
     could define encodings for these types as:

          #define PA_FOO  PA_LAST
          #define PA_BAR  (PA_LAST + 1)

   Here are the flag bits that modify a basic type.  They are combined
with the code for the basic type using inclusive-or.

'PA_FLAG_PTR'
     If this bit is set, it indicates that the encoded type is a pointer
     to the base type, rather than an immediate value.  For example,
     'PA_INT|PA_FLAG_PTR' represents the type 'int *'.

'PA_FLAG_SHORT'
     If this bit is set, it indicates that the base type is modified
     with 'short'.  (This corresponds to the 'h' type modifier.)

'PA_FLAG_LONG'
     If this bit is set, it indicates that the base type is modified
     with 'long'.  (This corresponds to the 'l' type modifier.)

'PA_FLAG_LONG_LONG'
     If this bit is set, it indicates that the base type is modified
     with 'long long'.  (This corresponds to the 'L' type modifier.)

'PA_FLAG_LONG_DOUBLE'
     This is a synonym for 'PA_FLAG_LONG_LONG', used by convention with
     a base type of 'PA_DOUBLE' to indicate a type of 'long double'.

   For an example of using these facilities, see *note Example of
Parsing::.

12.13 Customizing 'printf'
==========================

The GNU C Library lets you define your own custom conversion specifiers
for 'printf' template strings, to teach 'printf' clever ways to print
the important data structures of your program.

   The way you do this is by registering the conversion with the
function 'register_printf_function'; see *note Registering New
Conversions::.  One of the arguments you pass to this function is a
pointer to a handler function that produces the actual output; see *note
Defining the Output Handler::, for information on how to write this
function.

   You can also install a function that just returns information about
the number and type of arguments expected by the conversion specifier.
*Note Parsing a Template String::, for information about this.

   The facilities of this section are declared in the header file
'printf.h'.

* Menu:

* Registering New Conversions::         Using 'register_printf_function'
					 to register a new output conversion.
* Conversion Specifier Options::        The handler must be able to get
					 the options specified in the
					 template when it is called.
* Defining the Output Handler::         Defining the handler and arginfo

* Printf Extension Example::            How to define a 'printf'

   *Portability Note:* The ability to extend the syntax of 'printf'
template strings is a GNU extension.  ISO standard C has nothing
similar.

12.13.1 Registering New Conversions
-----------------------------------

The function to register a new output conversion is
'register_printf_function', declared in 'printf.h'.

 -- Function: int register_printf_function (int SPEC, printf_function
          HANDLER-FUNCTION, printf_arginfo_function ARGINFO-FUNCTION)
     This function defines the conversion specifier character SPEC.
     Thus, if SPEC is ''Y'', it defines the conversion '%Y'.  You can
     redefine the built-in conversions like '%s', but flag characters
     like '#' and type modifiers like 'l' can never be used as
     conversions; calling 'register_printf_function' for those
     characters has no effect.  It is advisable not to use lowercase
     letters, since the ISO C standard warns that additional lowercase
     letters may be standardized in future editions of the standard.

     The HANDLER-FUNCTION is the function called by 'printf' and friends
     when this conversion appears in a template string.  *Note Defining
     the Output Handler::, for information about how to define a
     function to pass as this argument.  If you specify a null pointer,
     any existing handler function for SPEC is removed.

     The ARGINFO-FUNCTION is the function called by
     'parse_printf_format' when this conversion appears in a template
     string.  *Note Parsing a Template String::, for information about
     this.

     *Attention:* In the GNU C Library versions before 2.0 the
     ARGINFO-FUNCTION function did not need to be installed unless the
     user used the 'parse_printf_format' function.  This has changed.
     Now a call to any of the 'printf' functions will call this function
     when this format specifier appears in the format string.

     The return value is '0' on success, and '-1' on failure (which
     occurs if SPEC is out of range).

     You can redefine the standard output conversions, but this is
     probably not a good idea because of the potential for confusion.
     Library routines written by other people could break if you do
     this.

12.13.2 Conversion Specifier Options
------------------------------------

If you define a meaning for '%A', what if the template contains '%+23A'
or '%-#A'?  To implement a sensible meaning for these, the handler when
called needs to be able to get the options specified in the template.

   Both the HANDLER-FUNCTION and ARGINFO-FUNCTION accept an argument
that points to a 'struct printf_info', which contains information about
the options appearing in an instance of the conversion specifier.  This
data type is declared in the header file 'printf.h'.

 -- Type: struct printf_info
     This structure is used to pass information about the options
     appearing in an instance of a conversion specifier in a 'printf'
     template string to the handler and arginfo functions for that
     specifier.  It contains the following members:

     'int prec'
          This is the precision specified.  The value is '-1' if no
          precision was specified.  If the precision was given as '*',
          the 'printf_info' structure passed to the handler function
          contains the actual value retrieved from the argument list.
          But the structure passed to the arginfo function contains a
          value of 'INT_MIN', since the actual value is not known.

     'int width'
          This is the minimum field width specified.  The value is '0'
          if no width was specified.  If the field width was given as
          '*', the 'printf_info' structure passed to the handler
          function contains the actual value retrieved from the argument
          list.  But the structure passed to the arginfo function
          contains a value of 'INT_MIN', since the actual value is not
          known.

     'wchar_t spec'
          This is the conversion specifier character specified.  It's
          stored in the structure so that you can register the same
          handler function for multiple characters, but still have a way
          to tell them apart when the handler function is called.

     'unsigned int is_long_double'
          This is a boolean that is true if the 'L', 'll', or 'q' type
          modifier was specified.  For integer conversions, this
          indicates 'long long int', as opposed to 'long double' for
          floating point conversions.

     'unsigned int is_char'
          This is a boolean that is true if the 'hh' type modifier was
          specified.

     'unsigned int is_short'
          This is a boolean that is true if the 'h' type modifier was
          specified.

     'unsigned int is_long'
          This is a boolean that is true if the 'l' type modifier was
          specified.

     'unsigned int alt'
          This is a boolean that is true if the '#' flag was specified.

     'unsigned int space'
          This is a boolean that is true if the ' ' flag was specified.

     'unsigned int left'
          This is a boolean that is true if the '-' flag was specified.

     'unsigned int showsign'
          This is a boolean that is true if the '+' flag was specified.

     'unsigned int group'
          This is a boolean that is true if the ''' flag was specified.

     'unsigned int extra'
          This flag has a special meaning depending on the context.  It
          could be used freely by the user-defined handlers but when
          called from the 'printf' function this variable always
          contains the value '0'.

     'unsigned int wide'
          This flag is set if the stream is wide oriented.

     'wchar_t pad'
          This is the character to use for padding the output to the
          minimum field width.  The value is ''0'' if the '0' flag was
          specified, and '' '' otherwise.

12.13.3 Defining the Output Handler
-----------------------------------

Now let's look at how to define the handler and arginfo functions which
are passed as arguments to 'register_printf_function'.

   *Compatibility Note:* The interface changed in the GNU C Library
version 2.0.  Previously the third argument was of type 'va_list *'.

   You should define your handler functions with a prototype like:

     int FUNCTION (FILE *stream, const struct printf_info *info,
     		    const void *const *args)

   The STREAM argument passed to the handler function is the stream to
which it should write output.

   The INFO argument is a pointer to a structure that contains
information about the various options that were included with the
conversion in the template string.  You should not modify this structure
inside your handler function.  *Note Conversion Specifier Options::, for
a description of this data structure.

   The ARGS is a vector of pointers to the arguments data.  The number
of arguments was determined by calling the argument information function
provided by the user.

   Your handler function should return a value just like 'printf' does:
it should return the number of characters it has written, or a negative
value to indicate an error.

 -- Data Type: printf_function
     This is the data type that a handler function should have.

   If you are going to use 'parse_printf_format' in your application,
you must also define a function to pass as the ARGINFO-FUNCTION argument
for each new conversion you install with 'register_printf_function'.

   You have to define these functions with a prototype like:

     int FUNCTION (const struct printf_info *info,
     		    size_t n, int *argtypes)

   The return value from the function should be the number of arguments
the conversion expects.  The function should also fill in no more than N
elements of the ARGTYPES array with information about the types of each
of these arguments.  This information is encoded using the various 'PA_'
macros.  (You will notice that this is the same calling convention
'parse_printf_format' itself uses.)

 -- Data Type: printf_arginfo_function
     This type is used to describe functions that return information
     about the number and type of arguments used by a conversion
     specifier.

12.13.4 'printf' Extension Example
----------------------------------

Here is an example showing how to define a 'printf' handler function.
This program defines a data structure called a 'Widget' and defines the
'%W' conversion to print information about 'Widget *' arguments,
including the pointer value and the name stored in the data structure.
The '%W' conversion supports the minimum field width and
left-justification options, but ignores everything else.


     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <stdlib.h>
     #include <printf.h>

     typedef struct
     {
       char *name;
     }
     Widget;

     int
     print_widget (FILE *stream,
                   const struct printf_info *info,
                   const void *const *args)
     {
       const Widget *w;
       char *buffer;
       int len;

       /* Format the output into a string. */
       w = *((const Widget **) (args[0]));
       len = asprintf (&buffer, "<Widget %p: %s>", w, w->name);
       if (len == -1)
         return -1;

       /* Pad to the minimum field width and print to the stream. */
       len = fprintf (stream, "%*s",
                      (info->left ? -info->width : info->width),
                      buffer);

       /* Clean up and return. */
       free (buffer);
       return len;
     }


     int
     print_widget_arginfo (const struct printf_info *info, size_t n,
                           int *argtypes)
     {
       /* We always take exactly one argument and this is a pointer to the
          structure.. */
       if (n > 0)
         argtypes[0] = PA_POINTER;
       return 1;
     }


     int
     main (void)
     {
       /* Make a widget to print. */
       Widget mywidget;
       mywidget.name = "mywidget";

       /* Register the print function for widgets. */
       register_printf_function ('W', print_widget, print_widget_arginfo);

       /* Now print the widget. */
       printf ("|%W|\n", &mywidget);
       printf ("|%35W|\n", &mywidget);
       printf ("|%-35W|\n", &mywidget);

       return 0;
     }

   The output produced by this program looks like:

     |<Widget 0xffeffb7c: mywidget>|
     |      <Widget 0xffeffb7c: mywidget>|
     |<Widget 0xffeffb7c: mywidget>      |

12.13.5 Predefined 'printf' Handlers
------------------------------------

The GNU C Library also contains a concrete and useful application of the
'printf' handler extension.  There are two functions available which
implement a special way to print floating-point numbers.

 -- Function: int printf_size (FILE *FP, const struct printf_info *INFO,
          const void *const *ARGS)
     Print a given floating point number as for the format '%f' except
     that there is a postfix character indicating the divisor for the
     number to make this less than 1000.  There are two possible
     divisors: powers of 1024 or powers of 1000.  Which one is used
     depends on the format character specified while registered this
     handler.  If the character is of lower case, 1024 is used.  For
     upper case characters, 1000 is used.

     The postfix tag corresponds to bytes, kilobytes, megabytes,
     gigabytes, etc.  The full table is:

     low   Multiplier    From    Upper   Multiplier
     ' '   1                     ' '     1
     k     2^10 (1024)   kilo    K       10^3 (1000)
     m     2^20          mega    M       10^6
     g     2^30          giga    G       10^9
     t     2^40          tera    T       10^12
     p     2^50          peta    P       10^15
     e     2^60          exa     E       10^18
     z     2^70          zetta   Z       10^21
     y     2^80          yotta   Y       10^24

     The default precision is 3, i.e., 1024 is printed with a lower-case
     format character as if it were '%.3fk' and will yield '1.000k'.

   Due to the requirements of 'register_printf_function' we must also
provide the function which returns information about the arguments.

 -- Function: int printf_size_info (const struct printf_info *INFO,
          size_t N, int *ARGTYPES)
     This function will return in ARGTYPES the information about the
     used parameters in the way the 'vfprintf' implementation expects
     it.  The format always takes one argument.

   To use these functions both functions must be registered with a call
like

     register_printf_function ('B', printf_size, printf_size_info);

   Here we register the functions to print numbers as powers of 1000
since the format character ''B'' is an upper-case character.  If we
would additionally use ''b'' in a line like

     register_printf_function ('b', printf_size, printf_size_info);

we could also print using a power of 1024.  Please note that all that is
different in these two lines is the format specifier.  The 'printf_size'
function knows about the difference between lower and upper case format
specifiers.

   The use of ''B'' and ''b'' is no coincidence.  Rather it is the
preferred way to use this functionality since it is available on some
other systems which also use format specifiers.

12.14 Formatted Input
=====================

The functions described in this section ('scanf' and related functions)
provide facilities for formatted input analogous to the formatted output
facilities.  These functions provide a mechanism for reading arbitrary
values under the control of a "format string" or "template string".

File: libc.info,  Node: Formatted Input Basics,  Next: Input Conversion Syntax,  Up: Formatted Input

12.14.1 Formatted Input Basics
------------------------------

Calls to 'scanf' are superficially similar to calls to 'printf' in that
arbitrary arguments are read under the control of a template string.
While the syntax of the conversion specifications in the template is
very similar to that for 'printf', the interpretation of the template is
oriented more towards free-format input and simple pattern matching,
rather than fixed-field formatting.  For example, most 'scanf'
conversions skip over any amount of "white space" (including spaces,
tabs, and newlines) in the input file, and there is no concept of
precision for the numeric input conversions as there is for the
corresponding output conversions.  Ordinarily, non-whitespace characters
in the template are expected to match characters in the input stream
exactly, but a matching failure is distinct from an input error on the
stream.

   Another area of difference between 'scanf' and 'printf' is that you
must remember to supply pointers rather than immediate values as the
optional arguments to 'scanf'; the values that are read are stored in
the objects that the pointers point to.  Even experienced programmers
tend to forget this occasionally, so if your program is getting strange
errors that seem to be related to 'scanf', you might want to
double-check this.

   When a "matching failure" occurs, 'scanf' returns immediately,
leaving the first non-matching character as the next character to be
read from the stream.  The normal return value from 'scanf' is the
number of values that were assigned, so you can use this to determine if
a matching error happened before all the expected values were read.

   The 'scanf' function is typically used for things like reading in the
contents of tables.  For example, here is a function that uses 'scanf'
to initialize an array of 'double':

     void
     readarray (double *array, int n)
     {
       int i;
       for (i=0; i<n; i++)
         if (scanf (" %lf", &(array[i])) != 1)
           invalid_input_error ();
     }

   The formatted input functions are not used as frequently as the
formatted output functions.  Partly, this is because it takes some care
to use them properly.  Another reason is that it is difficult to recover
from a matching error.

   If you are trying to read input that doesn't match a single, fixed
pattern, you may be better off using a tool such as Flex to generate a
lexical scanner, or Bison to generate a parser, rather than using
'scanf'.  For more information about these tools, see *note
(flex.info)Top::, and *note (bison.info)Top::.


File: libc.info,  Node: Input Conversion Syntax,  Next: Table of Input Conversions,  Prev: Formatted Input Basics,  Up: Formatted Input

12.14.2 Input Conversion Syntax
-------------------------------

A 'scanf' template string is a string that contains ordinary multibyte
characters interspersed with conversion specifications that start with
'%'.

   Any whitespace character (as defined by the 'isspace' function; *note
Classification of Characters::) in the template causes any number of
whitespace characters in the input stream to be read and discarded.  The
whitespace characters that are matched need not be exactly the same
whitespace characters that appear in the template string.  For example,
write ' , ' in the template to recognize a comma with optional
whitespace before and after.

   Other characters in the template string that are not part of
conversion specifications must match characters in the input stream
exactly; if this is not the case, a matching failure occurs.

   The conversion specifications in a 'scanf' template string have the
general form:

     % FLAGS WIDTH TYPE CONVERSION

   In more detail, an input conversion specification consists of an
initial '%' character followed in sequence by:

   * An optional "flag character" '*', which says to ignore the text
     read for this specification.  When 'scanf' finds a conversion
     specification that uses this flag, it reads input as directed by
     the rest of the conversion specification, but it discards this
     input, does not use a pointer argument, and does not increment the
     count of successful assignments.

   * An optional flag character 'a' (valid with string conversions only)
     which requests allocation of a buffer long enough to store the
     string in.  (This is a GNU extension.)  *Note Dynamic String
     Input::.

   * An optional decimal integer that specifies the "maximum field
     width".  Reading of characters from the input stream stops either
     when this maximum is reached or when a non-matching character is
     found, whichever happens first.  Most conversions discard initial
     whitespace characters (those that don't are explicitly documented),
     and these discarded characters don't count towards the maximum
     field width.  String input conversions store a null character to
     mark the end of the input; the maximum field width does not include
     this terminator.

   * An optional "type modifier character".  For example, you can
     specify a type modifier of 'l' with integer conversions such as
     '%d' to specify that the argument is a pointer to a 'long int'
     rather than a pointer to an 'int'.

   * A character that specifies the conversion to be applied.

   The exact options that are permitted and how they are interpreted
vary between the different conversion specifiers.  See the descriptions
of the individual conversions for information about the particular
options that they allow.

   With the '-Wformat' option, the GNU C compiler checks calls to
'scanf' and related functions.  It examines the format string and
verifies that the correct number and types of arguments are supplied.
There is also a GNU C syntax to tell the compiler that a function you
write uses a 'scanf'-style format string.  *Note Declaring Attributes of
Functions: (gcc.info)Function Attributes, for more information.


File: libc.info,  Node: Table of Input Conversions,  Next: Numeric Input Conversions,  Prev: Input Conversion Syntax,  Up: Formatted Input

12.14.3 Table of Input Conversions
----------------------------------

Here is a table that summarizes the various conversion specifications:

'%d'
     Matches an optionally signed integer written in decimal.  *Note
     Numeric Input Conversions::.

'%i'
     Matches an optionally signed integer in any of the formats that the
     C language defines for specifying an integer constant.  *Note
     Numeric Input Conversions::.

'%o'
     Matches an unsigned integer written in octal radix.  *Note Numeric
     Input Conversions::.

'%u'
     Matches an unsigned integer written in decimal radix.  *Note
     Numeric Input Conversions::.

'%x', '%X'
     Matches an unsigned integer written in hexadecimal radix.  *Note
     Numeric Input Conversions::.

'%e', '%f', '%g', '%E', '%G'
     Matches an optionally signed floating-point number.  *Note Numeric
     Input Conversions::.

'%s'

     Matches a string containing only non-whitespace characters.  *Note
     String Input Conversions::.  The presence of the 'l' modifier
     determines whether the output is stored as a wide character string
     or a multibyte string.  If '%s' is used in a wide character
     function the string is converted as with multiple calls to
     'wcrtomb' into a multibyte string.  This means that the buffer must
     provide room for 'MB_CUR_MAX' bytes for each wide character read.
     In case '%ls' is used in a multibyte function the result is
     converted into wide characters as with multiple calls of 'mbrtowc'
     before being stored in the user provided buffer.

'%S'
     This is an alias for '%ls' which is supported for compatibility
     with the Unix standard.

'%['
     Matches a string of characters that belong to a specified set.
     *Note String Input Conversions::.  The presence of the 'l' modifier
     determines whether the output is stored as a wide character string
     or a multibyte string.  If '%[' is used in a wide character
     function the string is converted as with multiple calls to
     'wcrtomb' into a multibyte string.  This means that the buffer must
     provide room for 'MB_CUR_MAX' bytes for each wide character read.
     In case '%l[' is used in a multibyte function the result is
     converted into wide characters as with multiple calls of 'mbrtowc'
     before being stored in the user provided buffer.

'%c'
     Matches a string of one or more characters; the number of
     characters read is controlled by the maximum field width given for
     the conversion.  *Note String Input Conversions::.

     If the '%c' is used in a wide stream function the read value is
     converted from a wide character to the corresponding multibyte
     character before storing it.  Note that this conversion can produce
     more than one byte of output and therefore the provided buffer be
     large enough for up to 'MB_CUR_MAX' bytes for each character.  If
     '%lc' is used in a multibyte function the input is treated as a
     multibyte sequence (and not bytes) and the result is converted as
     with calls to 'mbrtowc'.

'%C'
     This is an alias for '%lc' which is supported for compatibility
     with the Unix standard.

'%p'
     Matches a pointer value in the same implementation-defined format
     used by the '%p' output conversion for 'printf'.  *Note Other Input
     Conversions::.

'%n'
     This conversion doesn't read any characters; it records the number
     of characters read so far by this call.  *Note Other Input
     Conversions::.

'%%'
     This matches a literal '%' character in the input stream.  No
     corresponding argument is used.  *Note Other Input Conversions::.

   If the syntax of a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior
is undefined.  If there aren't enough function arguments provided to
supply addresses for all the conversion specifications in the template
strings that perform assignments, or if the arguments are not of the
correct types, the behavior is also undefined.  On the other hand, extra
arguments are simply ignored.

12.14.4 Numeric Input Conversions
---------------------------------

This section describes the 'scanf' conversions for reading numeric
values.

   The '%d' conversion matches an optionally signed integer in decimal
radix.  The syntax that is recognized is the same as that for the
'strtol' function (*note Parsing of Integers::) with the value '10' for
the BASE argument.

   The '%i' conversion matches an optionally signed integer in any of
the formats that the C language defines for specifying an integer
constant.  The syntax that is recognized is the same as that for the
'strtol' function (*note Parsing of Integers::) with the value '0' for
the BASE argument.  (You can print integers in this syntax with 'printf'
by using the '#' flag character with the '%x', '%o', or '%d' conversion.
*Note Integer Conversions::.)

   For example, any of the strings '10', '0xa', or '012' could be read
in as integers under the '%i' conversion.  Each of these specifies a
number with decimal value '10'.

   The '%o', '%u', and '%x' conversions match unsigned integers in
octal, decimal, and hexadecimal radices, respectively.  The syntax that
is recognized is the same as that for the 'strtoul' function (*note
Parsing of Integers::) with the appropriate value ('8', '10', or '16')
for the BASE argument.

   The '%X' conversion is identical to the '%x' conversion.  They both
permit either uppercase or lowercase letters to be used as digits.

   The default type of the corresponding argument for the '%d' and '%i'
conversions is 'int *', and 'unsigned int *' for the other integer
conversions.  You can use the following type modifiers to specify other
sizes of integer:

'hh'
     Specifies that the argument is a 'signed char *' or 'unsigned char
     *'.

     This modifier was introduced in ISO C99.

'h'
     Specifies that the argument is a 'short int *' or 'unsigned short
     int *'.

'j'
     Specifies that the argument is a 'intmax_t *' or 'uintmax_t *'.

     This modifier was introduced in ISO C99.

'l'
     Specifies that the argument is a 'long int *' or 'unsigned long int
     *'.  Two 'l' characters is like the 'L' modifier, below.

     If used with '%c' or '%s' the corresponding parameter is considered
     as a pointer to a wide character or wide character string
     respectively.  This use of 'l' was introduced in Amendment 1 to
     ISO C90.

'll'
'L'
'q'
     Specifies that the argument is a 'long long int *' or 'unsigned
     long long int *'.  (The 'long long' type is an extension supported
     by the GNU C compiler.  For systems that don't provide extra-long
     integers, this is the same as 'long int'.)

     The 'q' modifier is another name for the same thing, which comes
     from 4.4 BSD; a 'long long int' is sometimes called a "quad" 'int'.

't'
     Specifies that the argument is a 'ptrdiff_t *'.

     This modifier was introduced in ISO C99.

'z'
     Specifies that the argument is a 'size_t *'.

     This modifier was introduced in ISO C99.

   All of the '%e', '%f', '%g', '%E', and '%G' input conversions are
interchangeable.  They all match an optionally signed floating point
number, in the same syntax as for the 'strtod' function (*note Parsing
of Floats::).

   For the floating-point input conversions, the default argument type
is 'float *'.  (This is different from the corresponding output
conversions, where the default type is 'double'; remember that 'float'
arguments to 'printf' are converted to 'double' by the default argument
promotions, but 'float *' arguments are not promoted to 'double *'.)
You can specify other sizes of float using these type modifiers:

'l'
     Specifies that the argument is of type 'double *'.

'L'
     Specifies that the argument is of type 'long double *'.

   For all the above number parsing formats there is an additional
optional flag '''.  When this flag is given the 'scanf' function expects
the number represented in the input string to be formatted according to
the grouping rules of the currently selected locale (*note General
Numeric::).

   If the '"C"' or '"POSIX"' locale is selected there is no difference.
But for a locale which specifies values for the appropriate fields in
the locale the input must have the correct form in the input.  Otherwise
the longest prefix with a correct form is processed.

12.14.5 String Input Conversions
--------------------------------

This section describes the 'scanf' input conversions for reading string
and character values: '%s', '%S', '%[', '%c', and '%C'.

   You have two options for how to receive the input from these
conversions:

   * Provide a buffer to store it in.  This is the default.  You should
     provide an argument of type 'char *' or 'wchar_t *' (the latter of
     the 'l' modifier is present).

     *Warning:* To make a robust program, you must make sure that the
     input (plus its terminating null) cannot possibly exceed the size
     of the buffer you provide.  In general, the only way to do this is
     to specify a maximum field width one less than the buffer size.
     *If you provide the buffer, always specify a maximum field width to
     prevent overflow.*

   * Ask 'scanf' to allocate a big enough buffer, by specifying the 'a'
     flag character.  This is a GNU extension.  You should provide an
     argument of type 'char **' for the buffer address to be stored in.
     *Note Dynamic String Input::.

   The '%c' conversion is the simplest: it matches a fixed number of
characters, always.  The maximum field width says how many characters to
read; if you don't specify the maximum, the default is 1.  This
conversion doesn't append a null character to the end of the text it
reads.  It also does not skip over initial whitespace characters.  It
reads precisely the next N characters, and fails if it cannot get that
many.  Since there is always a maximum field width with '%c' (whether
specified, or 1 by default), you can always prevent overflow by making
the buffer long enough.

   If the format is '%lc' or '%C' the function stores wide characters
which are converted using the conversion determined at the time the
stream was opened from the external byte stream.  The number of bytes
read from the medium is limited by 'MB_CUR_LEN * N' but at most N wide
character get stored in the output string.

   The '%s' conversion matches a string of non-whitespace characters.
It skips and discards initial whitespace, but stops when it encounters
more whitespace after having read something.  It stores a null character
at the end of the text that it reads.

   For example, reading the input:

      hello, world

with the conversion '%10c' produces '" hello, wo"', but reading the same
input with the conversion '%10s' produces '"hello,"'.

   *Warning:* If you do not specify a field width for '%s', then the
number of characters read is limited only by where the next whitespace
character appears.  This almost certainly means that invalid input can
make your program crash--which is a bug.

   The '%ls' and '%S' format are handled just like '%s' except that the
external byte sequence is converted using the conversion associated with
the stream to wide characters with their own encoding.  A width or
precision specified with the format do not directly determine how many
bytes are read from the stream since they measure wide characters.  But
an upper limit can be computed by multiplying the value of the width or
precision by 'MB_CUR_MAX'.

   To read in characters that belong to an arbitrary set of your choice,
use the '%[' conversion.  You specify the set between the '[' character
and a following ']' character, using the same syntax used in regular
expressions.  As special cases:

   * A literal ']' character can be specified as the first character of
     the set.

   * An embedded '-' character (that is, one that is not the first or
     last character of the set) is used to specify a range of
     characters.

   * If a caret character '^' immediately follows the initial '[', then
     the set of allowed input characters is the everything _except_ the
     characters listed.

   The '%[' conversion does not skip over initial whitespace characters.

   Here are some examples of '%[' conversions and what they mean:

'%25[1234567890]'
     Matches a string of up to 25 digits.

'%25[][]'
     Matches a string of up to 25 square brackets.

'%25[^ \f\n\r\t\v]'
     Matches a string up to 25 characters long that doesn't contain any
     of the standard whitespace characters.  This is slightly different
     from '%s', because if the input begins with a whitespace character,
     '%[' reports a matching failure while '%s' simply discards the
     initial whitespace.

'%25[a-z]'
     Matches up to 25 lowercase characters.

   As for '%c' and '%s' the '%[' format is also modified to produce wide
characters if the 'l' modifier is present.  All what is said about '%ls'
above is true for '%l['.

   One more reminder: the '%s' and '%[' conversions are *dangerous* if
you don't specify a maximum width or use the 'a' flag, because input too
long would overflow whatever buffer you have provided for it.  No matter
how long your buffer is, a user could supply input that is longer.  A
well-written program reports invalid input with a comprehensible error
message, not with a crash.

12.14.6 Dynamically Allocating String Conversions
-------------------------------------------------

A GNU extension to formatted input lets you safely read a string with no
maximum size.  Using this feature, you don't supply a buffer; instead,
'scanf' allocates a buffer big enough to hold the data and gives you its
address.  To use this feature, write 'a' as a flag character, as in
'%as' or '%a[0-9a-z]'.

   The pointer argument you supply for where to store the input should
have type 'char **'.  The 'scanf' function allocates a buffer and stores
its address in the word that the argument points to.  You should free
the buffer with 'free' when you no longer need it.

   Here is an example of using the 'a' flag with the '%[...]' conversion
specification to read a "variable assignment" of the form 'VARIABLE =
VALUE'.

     {
       char *variable, *value;

       if (2 > scanf ("%a[a-zA-Z0-9] = %a[^\n]\n",
     		 &variable, &value))
         {
           invalid_input_error ();
           return 0;
         }

       ...
     }


File: libc.info,  Node: Other Input Conversions,  Next: Formatted Input Functions,  Prev: Dynamic String Input,  Up: Formatted Input

12.14.7 Other Input Conversions
-------------------------------

This section describes the miscellaneous input conversions.

   The '%p' conversion is used to read a pointer value.  It recognizes
the same syntax used by the '%p' output conversion for 'printf' (*note
Other Output Conversions::); that is, a hexadecimal number just as the
'%x' conversion accepts.  The corresponding argument should be of type
'void **'; that is, the address of a place to store a pointer.

   The resulting pointer value is not guaranteed to be valid if it was
not originally written during the same program execution that reads it
in.

   The '%n' conversion produces the number of characters read so far by
this call.  The corresponding argument should be of type 'int *'.  This
conversion works in the same way as the '%n' conversion for 'printf';
see *note Other Output Conversions::, for an example.

   The '%n' conversion is the only mechanism for determining the success
of literal matches or conversions with suppressed assignments.  If the
'%n' follows the locus of a matching failure, then no value is stored
for it since 'scanf' returns before processing the '%n'.  If you store
'-1' in that argument slot before calling 'scanf', the presence of '-1'
after 'scanf' indicates an error occurred before the '%n' was reached.

   Finally, the '%%' conversion matches a literal '%' character in the
input stream, without using an argument.  This conversion does not
permit any flags, field width, or type modifier to be specified.

12.14.8 Formatted Input Functions
---------------------------------

Here are the descriptions of the functions for performing formatted
input.  Prototypes for these functions are in the header file 'stdio.h'.

 -- Function: int scanf (const char *TEMPLATE, ...)
     The 'scanf' function reads formatted input from the stream 'stdin'
     under the control of the template string TEMPLATE.  The optional
     arguments are pointers to the places which receive the resulting
     values.

     The return value is normally the number of successful assignments.
     If an end-of-file condition is detected before any matches are
     performed, including matches against whitespace and literal
     characters in the template, then 'EOF' is returned.

 -- Function: int wscanf (const wchar_t *TEMPLATE, ...)
     The 'wscanf' function reads formatted input from the stream 'stdin'
     under the control of the template string TEMPLATE.  The optional
     arguments are pointers to the places which receive the resulting
     values.

     The return value is normally the number of successful assignments.
     If an end-of-file condition is detected before any matches are
     performed, including matches against whitespace and literal
     characters in the template, then 'WEOF' is returned.

 -- Function: int fscanf (FILE *STREAM, const char *TEMPLATE, ...)
     This function is just like 'scanf', except that the input is read
     from the stream STREAM instead of 'stdin'.

 -- Function: int fwscanf (FILE *STREAM, const wchar_t *TEMPLATE, ...)
     This function is just like 'wscanf', except that the input is read
     from the stream STREAM instead of 'stdin'.

 -- Function: int sscanf (const char *S, const char *TEMPLATE, ...)
     This is like 'scanf', except that the characters are taken from the
     null-terminated string S instead of from a stream.  Reaching the
     end of the string is treated as an end-of-file condition.

     The behavior of this function is undefined if copying takes place
     between objects that overlap--for example, if S is also given as an
     argument to receive a string read under control of the '%s', '%S',
     or '%[' conversion.

 -- Function: int swscanf (const wchar_t *WS, const wchar_t *TEMPLATE,
          ...)
     This is like 'wscanf', except that the characters are taken from
     the null-terminated string WS instead of from a stream.  Reaching
     the end of the string is treated as an end-of-file condition.

     The behavior of this function is undefined if copying takes place
     between objects that overlap--for example, if WS is also given as
     an argument to receive a string read under control of the '%s',
     '%S', or '%[' conversion.

12.14.9 Variable Arguments Input Functions
------------------------------------------

The functions 'vscanf' and friends are provided so that you can define
your own variadic 'scanf'-like functions that make use of the same
internals as the built-in formatted output functions.  These functions
are analogous to the 'vprintf' series of output functions.  *Note
Variable Arguments Output::, for important information on how to use
them.

   *Portability Note:* The functions listed in this section were
introduced in ISO C99 and were before available as GNU extensions.

 -- Function: int vscanf (const char *TEMPLATE, va_list AP)
     This function is similar to 'scanf', but instead of taking a
     variable number of arguments directly, it takes an argument list
     pointer AP of type 'va_list' (*note Variadic Functions::).

 -- Function: int vwscanf (const wchar_t *TEMPLATE, va_list AP)
     This function is similar to 'wscanf', but instead of taking a
     variable number of arguments directly, it takes an argument list
     pointer AP of type 'va_list' (*note Variadic Functions::).

 -- Function: int vfscanf (FILE *STREAM, const char *TEMPLATE, va_list
          AP)
     This is the equivalent of 'fscanf' with the variable argument list
     specified directly as for 'vscanf'.

 -- Function: int vfwscanf (FILE *STREAM, const wchar_t *TEMPLATE,
          va_list AP)
     This is the equivalent of 'fwscanf' with the variable argument list
     specified directly as for 'vwscanf'.

 -- Function: int vsscanf (const char *S, const char *TEMPLATE, va_list
          AP)
     This is the equivalent of 'sscanf' with the variable argument list
     specified directly as for 'vscanf'.

 -- Function: int vswscanf (const wchar_t *S, const wchar_t *TEMPLATE,
          va_list AP)
     This is the equivalent of 'swscanf' with the variable argument list
     specified directly as for 'vwscanf'.

   In GNU C, there is a special construct you can use to let the
compiler know that a function uses a 'scanf'-style format string.  Then
it can check the number and types of arguments in each call to the
function, and warn you when they do not match the format string.  For
details, see *note Declaring Attributes of Functions: (gcc.info)Function
Attributes.


File: libc.info,  Node: EOF and Errors,  Next: Error Recovery,  Prev: Formatted Input,  Up: I/O on Streams

12.15 End-Of-File and Errors
============================

Many of the functions described in this chapter return the value of the
macro 'EOF' to indicate unsuccessful completion of the operation.  Since
'EOF' is used to report both end of file and random errors, it's often
better to use the 'feof' function to check explicitly for end of file
and 'ferror' to check for errors.  These functions check indicators that
are part of the internal state of the stream object, indicators set if
the appropriate condition was detected by a previous I/O operation on
that stream.

 -- Macro: int EOF
     This macro is an integer value that is returned by a number of
     narrow stream functions to indicate an end-of-file condition, or
     some other error situation.  With the GNU C Library, 'EOF' is '-1'.
     In other libraries, its value may be some other negative number.

     This symbol is declared in 'stdio.h'.

 -- Macro: int WEOF
     This macro is an integer value that is returned by a number of wide
     stream functions to indicate an end-of-file condition, or some
     other error situation.  With the GNU C Library, 'WEOF' is '-1'.  In
     other libraries, its value may be some other negative number.

     This symbol is declared in 'wchar.h'.

 -- Function: int feof (FILE *STREAM)
     The 'feof' function returns nonzero if and only if the end-of-file
     indicator for the stream STREAM is set.

     This symbol is declared in 'stdio.h'.

 -- Function: int feof_unlocked (FILE *STREAM)
     The 'feof_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'feof' function
     except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

     This function is a GNU extension.

     This symbol is declared in 'stdio.h'.

 -- Function: int ferror (FILE *STREAM)
     The 'ferror' function returns nonzero if and only if the error
     indicator for the stream STREAM is set, indicating that an error
     has occurred on a previous operation on the stream.

     This symbol is declared in 'stdio.h'.

 -- Function: int ferror_unlocked (FILE *STREAM)
     The 'ferror_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'ferror'
     function except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

     This function is a GNU extension.

     This symbol is declared in 'stdio.h'.

   In addition to setting the error indicator associated with the
stream, the functions that operate on streams also set 'errno' in the
same way as the corresponding low-level functions that operate on file
descriptors.  For example, all of the functions that perform output to a
stream--such as 'fputc', 'printf', and 'fflush'--are implemented in
terms of 'write', and all of the 'errno' error conditions defined for
'write' are meaningful for these functions.  For more information about
the descriptor-level I/O functions, see *note Low-Level I/O::.


File: libc.info,  Node: Error Recovery,  Next: Binary Streams,  Prev: EOF and Errors,  Up: I/O on Streams

12.16 Recovering from errors
============================

You may explicitly clear the error and EOF flags with the 'clearerr'
function.

 -- Function: void clearerr (FILE *STREAM)
     This function clears the end-of-file and error indicators for the
     stream STREAM.

     The file positioning functions (*note File Positioning::) also
     clear the end-of-file indicator for the stream.

 -- Function: void clearerr_unlocked (FILE *STREAM)
     The 'clearerr_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'clearerr'
     function except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

     This function is a GNU extension.

   Note that it is _not_ correct to just clear the error flag and retry
a failed stream operation.  After a failed write, any number of
characters since the last buffer flush may have been committed to the
file, while some buffered data may have been discarded.  Merely retrying
can thus cause lost or repeated data.

   A failed read may leave the file pointer in an inappropriate position
for a second try.  In both cases, you should seek to a known position
before retrying.

   Most errors that can happen are not recoverable -- a second try will
always fail again in the same way.  So usually it is best to give up and
report the error to the user, rather than install complicated recovery
logic.

   One important exception is 'EINTR' (*note Interrupted Primitives::).
Many stream I/O implementations will treat it as an ordinary error,
which can be quite inconvenient.  You can avoid this hassle by
installing all signals with the 'SA_RESTART' flag.

   For similar reasons, setting nonblocking I/O on a stream's file
descriptor is not usually advisable.

12.17 Text and Binary Streams
=============================

GNU systems and other POSIX-compatible operating systems organize all
files as uniform sequences of characters.  However, some other systems
make a distinction between files containing text and files containing
binary data, and the input and output facilities of ISO C provide for
this distinction.  This section tells you how to write programs portable
to such systems.

   When you open a stream, you can specify either a "text stream" or a
"binary stream".  You indicate that you want a binary stream by
specifying the 'b' modifier in the OPENTYPE argument to 'fopen'; see
*note Opening Streams::.  Without this option, 'fopen' opens the file as
a text stream.

   Text and binary streams differ in several ways:

   * The data read from a text stream is divided into "lines" which are
     terminated by newline (''\n'') characters, while a binary stream is
     simply a long series of characters.  A text stream might on some
     systems fail to handle lines more than 254 characters long
     (including the terminating newline character).

   * On some systems, text files can contain only printing characters,
     horizontal tab characters, and newlines, and so text streams may
     not support other characters.  However, binary streams can handle
     any character value.

   * Space characters that are written immediately preceding a newline
     character in a text stream may disappear when the file is read in
     again.

   * More generally, there need not be a one-to-one mapping between
     characters that are read from or written to a text stream, and the
     characters in the actual file.

   Since a binary stream is always more capable and more predictable
than a text stream, you might wonder what purpose text streams serve.
Why not simply always use binary streams?  The answer is that on these
operating systems, text and binary streams use different file formats,
and the only way to read or write "an ordinary file of text" that can
work with other text-oriented programs is through a text stream.

   In the GNU C Library, and on all POSIX systems, there is no
difference between text streams and binary streams.  When you open a
stream, you get the same kind of stream regardless of whether you ask
for binary.  This stream can handle any file content, and has none of
the restrictions that text streams sometimes have.


File: libc.info,  Node: File Positioning,  Next: Portable Positioning,  Prev: Binary Streams,  Up: I/O on Streams

12.18 File Positioning
======================

The "file position" of a stream describes where in the file the stream
is currently reading or writing.  I/O on the stream advances the file
position through the file.  On GNU systems, the file position is
represented as an integer, which counts the number of bytes from the
beginning of the file.  *Note File Position::.

   During I/O to an ordinary disk file, you can change the file position
whenever you wish, so as to read or write any portion of the file.  Some
other kinds of files may also permit this.  Files which support changing
the file position are sometimes referred to as "random-access" files.

   You can use the functions in this section to examine or modify the
file position indicator associated with a stream.  The symbols listed
below are declared in the header file 'stdio.h'.

 -- Function: long int ftell (FILE *STREAM)
     This function returns the current file position of the stream
     STREAM.

     This function can fail if the stream doesn't support file
     positioning, or if the file position can't be represented in a
     'long int', and possibly for other reasons as well.  If a failure
     occurs, a value of '-1' is returned.

 -- Function: off_t ftello (FILE *STREAM)
     The 'ftello' function is similar to 'ftell', except that it returns
     a value of type 'off_t'.  Systems which support this type use it to
     describe all file positions, unlike the POSIX specification which
     uses a long int.  The two are not necessarily the same size.
     Therefore, using ftell can lead to problems if the implementation
     is written on top of a POSIX compliant low-level I/O
     implementation, and using 'ftello' is preferable whenever it is
     available.

     If this function fails it returns '(off_t) -1'.  This can happen
     due to missing support for file positioning or internal errors.
     Otherwise the return value is the current file position.

     The function is an extension defined in the Unix Single
     Specification version 2.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32 bit system this function is in fact 'ftello64'.  I.e., the LFS
     interface transparently replaces the old interface.

 -- Function: off64_t ftello64 (FILE *STREAM)
     This function is similar to 'ftello' with the only difference that
     the return value is of type 'off64_t'.  This also requires that the
     stream STREAM was opened using either 'fopen64', 'freopen64', or
     'tmpfile64' since otherwise the underlying file operations to
     position the file pointer beyond the 2^31 bytes limit might fail.

     If the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a 32
     bits machine this function is available under the name 'ftello' and
     so transparently replaces the old interface.

 -- Function: int fseek (FILE *STREAM, long int OFFSET, int WHENCE)
     The 'fseek' function is used to change the file position of the
     stream STREAM.  The value of WHENCE must be one of the constants
     'SEEK_SET', 'SEEK_CUR', or 'SEEK_END', to indicate whether the
     OFFSET is relative to the beginning of the file, the current file
     position, or the end of the file, respectively.

     This function returns a value of zero if the operation was
     successful, and a nonzero value to indicate failure.  A successful
     call also clears the end-of-file indicator of STREAM and discards
     any characters that were "pushed back" by the use of 'ungetc'.

     'fseek' either flushes any buffered output before setting the file
     position or else remembers it so it will be written later in its
     proper place in the file.

 -- Function: int fseeko (FILE *STREAM, off_t OFFSET, int WHENCE)
     This function is similar to 'fseek' but it corrects a problem with
     'fseek' in a system with POSIX types.  Using a value of type 'long
     int' for the offset is not compatible with POSIX. 'fseeko' uses the
     correct type 'off_t' for the OFFSET parameter.

     For this reason it is a good idea to prefer 'ftello' whenever it is
     available since its functionality is (if different at all) closer
     the underlying definition.

     The functionality and return value is the same as for 'fseek'.

     The function is an extension defined in the Unix Single
     Specification version 2.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32 bit system this function is in fact 'fseeko64'.  I.e., the LFS
     interface transparently replaces the old interface.

 -- Function: int fseeko64 (FILE *STREAM, off64_t OFFSET, int WHENCE)
     This function is similar to 'fseeko' with the only difference that
     the OFFSET parameter is of type 'off64_t'.  This also requires that
     the stream STREAM was opened using either 'fopen64', 'freopen64',
     or 'tmpfile64' since otherwise the underlying file operations to
     position the file pointer beyond the 2^31 bytes limit might fail.

     If the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a 32
     bits machine this function is available under the name 'fseeko' and
     so transparently replaces the old interface.

   *Portability Note:* In non-POSIX systems, 'ftell', 'ftello', 'fseek'
and 'fseeko' might work reliably only on binary streams.  *Note Binary
Streams::.

   The following symbolic constants are defined for use as the WHENCE
argument to 'fseek'.  They are also used with the 'lseek' function
(*note I/O Primitives::) and to specify offsets for file locks (*note
Control Operations::).

 -- Macro: int SEEK_SET
     This is an integer constant which, when used as the WHENCE argument
     to the 'fseek' or 'fseeko' function, specifies that the offset
     provided is relative to the beginning of the file.

 -- Macro: int SEEK_CUR
     This is an integer constant which, when used as the WHENCE argument
     to the 'fseek' or 'fseeko' function, specifies that the offset
     provided is relative to the current file position.

 -- Macro: int SEEK_END
     This is an integer constant which, when used as the WHENCE argument
     to the 'fseek' or 'fseeko' function, specifies that the offset
     provided is relative to the end of the file.

 -- Function: void rewind (FILE *STREAM)
     The 'rewind' function positions the stream STREAM at the beginning
     of the file.  It is equivalent to calling 'fseek' or 'fseeko' on
     the STREAM with an OFFSET argument of '0L' and a WHENCE argument of
     'SEEK_SET', except that the return value is discarded and the error
     indicator for the stream is reset.

   These three aliases for the 'SEEK_...' constants exist for the sake
of compatibility with older BSD systems.  They are defined in two
different header files: 'fcntl.h' and 'sys/file.h'.

'L_SET'
     An alias for 'SEEK_SET'.

'L_INCR'
     An alias for 'SEEK_CUR'.

'L_XTND'
     An alias for 'SEEK_END'.

12.19 Portable File-Position Functions
======================================

On GNU systems, the file position is truly a character count.  You can
specify any character count value as an argument to 'fseek' or 'fseeko'
and get reliable results for any random access file.  However, some ISO C
systems do not represent file positions in this way.

   On some systems where text streams truly differ from binary streams,
it is impossible to represent the file position of a text stream as a
count of characters from the beginning of the file.  For example, the
file position on some systems must encode both a record offset within
the file, and a character offset within the record.

   As a consequence, if you want your programs to be portable to these
systems, you must observe certain rules:

   * The value returned from 'ftell' on a text stream has no predictable
     relationship to the number of characters you have read so far.  The
     only thing you can rely on is that you can use it subsequently as
     the OFFSET argument to 'fseek' or 'fseeko' to move back to the same
     file position.

   * In a call to 'fseek' or 'fseeko' on a text stream, either the
     OFFSET must be zero, or WHENCE must be 'SEEK_SET' and the OFFSET
     must be the result of an earlier call to 'ftell' on the same
     stream.

   * The value of the file position indicator of a text stream is
     undefined while there are characters that have been pushed back
     with 'ungetc' that haven't been read or discarded.  *Note
     Unreading::.

   But even if you observe these rules, you may still have trouble for
long files, because 'ftell' and 'fseek' use a 'long int' value to
represent the file position.  This type may not have room to encode all
the file positions in a large file.  Using the 'ftello' and 'fseeko'
functions might help here since the 'off_t' type is expected to be able
to hold all file position values but this still does not help to handle
additional information which must be associated with a file position.

   So if you do want to support systems with peculiar encodings for the
file positions, it is better to use the functions 'fgetpos' and
'fsetpos' instead.  These functions represent the file position using
the data type 'fpos_t', whose internal representation varies from system
to system.

   These symbols are declared in the header file 'stdio.h'.

 -- Data Type: fpos_t
     This is the type of an object that can encode information about the
     file position of a stream, for use by the functions 'fgetpos' and
     'fsetpos'.

     In the GNU C Library, 'fpos_t' is an opaque data structure that
     contains internal data to represent file offset and conversion
     state information.  In other systems, it might have a different
     internal representation.

     When compiling with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a 32 bit machine
     this type is in fact equivalent to 'fpos64_t' since the LFS
     interface transparently replaces the old interface.

 -- Data Type: fpos64_t
     This is the type of an object that can encode information about the
     file position of a stream, for use by the functions 'fgetpos64' and
     'fsetpos64'.

     In the GNU C Library, 'fpos64_t' is an opaque data structure that
     contains internal data to represent file offset and conversion
     state information.  In other systems, it might have a different
     internal representation.

 -- Function: int fgetpos (FILE *STREAM, fpos_t *POSITION)
     This function stores the value of the file position indicator for
     the stream STREAM in the 'fpos_t' object pointed to by POSITION.
     If successful, 'fgetpos' returns zero; otherwise it returns a
     nonzero value and stores an implementation-defined positive value
     in 'errno'.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32 bit system the function is in fact 'fgetpos64'.  I.e., the LFS
     interface transparently replaces the old interface.

 -- Function: int fgetpos64 (FILE *STREAM, fpos64_t *POSITION)
     This function is similar to 'fgetpos' but the file position is
     returned in a variable of type 'fpos64_t' to which POSITION points.

     If the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a 32
     bits machine this function is available under the name 'fgetpos'
     and so transparently replaces the old interface.

 -- Function: int fsetpos (FILE *STREAM, const fpos_t *POSITION)
     This function sets the file position indicator for the stream
     STREAM to the position POSITION, which must have been set by a
     previous call to 'fgetpos' on the same stream.  If successful,
     'fsetpos' clears the end-of-file indicator on the stream, discards
     any characters that were "pushed back" by the use of 'ungetc', and
     returns a value of zero.  Otherwise, 'fsetpos' returns a nonzero
     value and stores an implementation-defined positive value in
     'errno'.

     When the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a
     32 bit system the function is in fact 'fsetpos64'.  I.e., the LFS
     interface transparently replaces the old interface.

 -- Function: int fsetpos64 (FILE *STREAM, const fpos64_t *POSITION)
     This function is similar to 'fsetpos' but the file position used
     for positioning is provided in a variable of type 'fpos64_t' to
     which POSITION points.

     If the sources are compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on a 32
     bits machine this function is available under the name 'fsetpos'
     and so transparently replaces the old interface.

12.20 Stream Buffering
======================

Characters that are written to a stream are normally accumulated and
transmitted asynchronously to the file in a block, instead of appearing
as soon as they are output by the application program.  Similarly,
streams often retrieve input from the host environment in blocks rather
than on a character-by-character basis.  This is called "buffering".

   If you are writing programs that do interactive input and output
using streams, you need to understand how buffering works when you
design the user interface to your program.  Otherwise, you might find
that output (such as progress or prompt messages) doesn't appear when
you intended it to, or displays some other unexpected behavior.

   This section deals only with controlling when characters are
transmitted between the stream and the file or device, and _not_ with
how things like echoing, flow control, and the like are handled on
specific classes of devices.  For information on common control
operations on terminal devices, see *note Low-Level Terminal
Interface::.

   You can bypass the stream buffering facilities altogether by using
the low-level input and output functions that operate on file
descriptors instead.  *Note Low-Level I/O::.

* Menu:

* Buffering Concepts::          Terminology is defined here.
* Flushing Buffers::            How to ensure that output buffers are flushed.
* Controlling Buffering::       How to specify what kind of buffering to use.


File: libc.info,  Node: Buffering Concepts,  Next: Flushing Buffers,  Up: Stream Buffering

12.20.1 Buffering Concepts
--------------------------

There are three different kinds of buffering strategies:

   * Characters written to or read from an "unbuffered" stream are
     transmitted individually to or from the file as soon as possible.

   * Characters written to a "line buffered" stream are transmitted to
     the file in blocks when a newline character is encountered.

   * Characters written to or read from a "fully buffered" stream are
     transmitted to or from the file in blocks of arbitrary size.

   Newly opened streams are normally fully buffered, with one exception:
a stream connected to an interactive device such as a terminal is
initially line buffered.  *Note Controlling Buffering::, for information
on how to select a different kind of buffering.  Usually the automatic
selection gives you the most convenient kind of buffering for the file
or device you open.

   The use of line buffering for interactive devices implies that output
messages ending in a newline will appear immediately--which is usually
what you want.  Output that doesn't end in a newline might or might not
show up immediately, so if you want them to appear immediately, you
should flush buffered output explicitly with 'fflush', as described in
*note Flushing Buffers::.


File: libc.info,  Node: Flushing Buffers,  Next: Controlling Buffering,  Prev: Buffering Concepts,  Up: Stream Buffering

12.20.2 Flushing Buffers
------------------------

"Flushing" output on a buffered stream means transmitting all
accumulated characters to the file.  There are many circumstances when
buffered output on a stream is flushed automatically:

   * When you try to do output and the output buffer is full.

   * When the stream is closed.  *Note Closing Streams::.

   * When the program terminates by calling 'exit'.  *Note Normal
     Termination::.

   * When a newline is written, if the stream is line buffered.

   * Whenever an input operation on _any_ stream actually reads data
     from its file.

   If you want to flush the buffered output at another time, call
'fflush', which is declared in the header file 'stdio.h'.

 -- Function: int fflush (FILE *STREAM)
     This function causes any buffered output on STREAM to be delivered
     to the file.  If STREAM is a null pointer, then 'fflush' causes
     buffered output on _all_ open output streams to be flushed.

     This function returns 'EOF' if a write error occurs, or zero
     otherwise.

 -- Function: int fflush_unlocked (FILE *STREAM)
     The 'fflush_unlocked' function is equivalent to the 'fflush'
     function except that it does not implicitly lock the stream.

   The 'fflush' function can be used to flush all streams currently
opened.  While this is useful in some situations it does often more than
necessary since it might be done in situations when terminal input is
required and the program wants to be sure that all output is visible on
the terminal.  But this means that only line buffered streams have to be
flushed.  Solaris introduced a function especially for this.  It was
always available in the GNU C Library in some form but never officially
exported.

 -- Function: void _flushlbf (void)
     The '_flushlbf' function flushes all line buffered streams
     currently opened.

     This function is declared in the 'stdio_ext.h' header.

   *Compatibility Note:* Some brain-damaged operating systems have been
known to be so thoroughly fixated on line-oriented input and output that
flushing a line buffered stream causes a newline to be written!
Fortunately, this "feature" seems to be becoming less common.  You do
not need to worry about this with the GNU C Library.

   In some situations it might be useful to not flush the output pending
for a stream but instead simply forget it.  If transmission is costly
and the output is not needed anymore this is valid reasoning.  In this
situation a non-standard function introduced in Solaris and available in
the GNU C Library can be used.

 -- Function: void __fpurge (FILE *STREAM)
     The '__fpurge' function causes the buffer of the stream STREAM to
     be emptied.  If the stream is currently in read mode all input in
     the buffer is lost.  If the stream is in output mode the buffered
     output is not written to the device (or whatever other underlying
     storage) and the buffer the cleared.

     This function is declared in 'stdio_ext.h'.


File: libc.info,  Node: Controlling Buffering,  Prev: Flushing Buffers,  Up: Stream Buffering

12.20.3 Controlling Which Kind of Buffering
-------------------------------------------

After opening a stream (but before any other operations have been
performed on it), you can explicitly specify what kind of buffering you
want it to have using the 'setvbuf' function.

   The facilities listed in this section are declared in the header file
'stdio.h'.

 -- Function: int setvbuf (FILE *STREAM, char *BUF, int MODE, size_t
          SIZE)
     This function is used to specify that the stream STREAM should have
     the buffering mode MODE, which can be either '_IOFBF' (for full
     buffering), '_IOLBF' (for line buffering), or '_IONBF' (for
     unbuffered input/output).

     If you specify a null pointer as the BUF argument, then 'setvbuf'
     allocates a buffer itself using 'malloc'.  This buffer will be
     freed when you close the stream.

     Otherwise, BUF should be a character array that can hold at least
     SIZE characters.  You should not free the space for this array as
     long as the stream remains open and this array remains its buffer.
     You should usually either allocate it statically, or 'malloc'
     (*note Unconstrained Allocation::) the buffer.  Using an automatic
     array is not a good idea unless you close the file before exiting
     the block that declares the array.

     While the array remains a stream buffer, the stream I/O functions
     will use the buffer for their internal purposes.  You shouldn't try
     to access the values in the array directly while the stream is
     using it for buffering.

     The 'setvbuf' function returns zero on success, or a nonzero value
     if the value of MODE is not valid or if the request could not be
     honored.

 -- Macro: int _IOFBF
     The value of this macro is an integer constant expression that can
     be used as the MODE argument to the 'setvbuf' function to specify
     that the stream should be fully buffered.

 -- Macro: int _IOLBF
     The value of this macro is an integer constant expression that can
     be used as the MODE argument to the 'setvbuf' function to specify
     that the stream should be line buffered.

 -- Macro: int _IONBF
     The value of this macro is an integer constant expression that can
     be used as the MODE argument to the 'setvbuf' function to specify
     that the stream should be unbuffered.

 -- Macro: int BUFSIZ
     The value of this macro is an integer constant expression that is
     good to use for the SIZE argument to 'setvbuf'.  This value is
     guaranteed to be at least '256'.

     The value of 'BUFSIZ' is chosen on each system so as to make stream
     I/O efficient.  So it is a good idea to use 'BUFSIZ' as the size
     for the buffer when you call 'setvbuf'.

     Actually, you can get an even better value to use for the buffer
     size by means of the 'fstat' system call: it is found in the
     'st_blksize' field of the file attributes.  *Note Attribute
     Meanings::.

     Sometimes people also use 'BUFSIZ' as the allocation size of
     buffers used for related purposes, such as strings used to receive
     a line of input with 'fgets' (*note Character Input::).  There is
     no particular reason to use 'BUFSIZ' for this instead of any other
     integer, except that it might lead to doing I/O in chunks of an
     efficient size.

 -- Function: void setbuf (FILE *STREAM, char *BUF)
     If BUF is a null pointer, the effect of this function is equivalent
     to calling 'setvbuf' with a MODE argument of '_IONBF'.  Otherwise,
     it is equivalent to calling 'setvbuf' with BUF, and a MODE of
     '_IOFBF' and a SIZE argument of 'BUFSIZ'.

     The 'setbuf' function is provided for compatibility with old code;
     use 'setvbuf' in all new programs.

 -- Function: void setbuffer (FILE *STREAM, char *BUF, size_t SIZE)
     If BUF is a null pointer, this function makes STREAM unbuffered.
     Otherwise, it makes STREAM fully buffered using BUF as the buffer.
     The SIZE argument specifies the length of BUF.

     This function is provided for compatibility with old BSD code.  Use
     'setvbuf' instead.

 -- Function: void setlinebuf (FILE *STREAM)
     This function makes STREAM be line buffered, and allocates the
     buffer for you.

     This function is provided for compatibility with old BSD code.  Use
     'setvbuf' instead.

   It is possible to query whether a given stream is line buffered or
not using a non-standard function introduced in Solaris and available in
the GNU C Library.

 -- Function: int __flbf (FILE *STREAM)
     The '__flbf' function will return a nonzero value in case the
     stream STREAM is line buffered.  Otherwise the return value is
     zero.

     This function is declared in the 'stdio_ext.h' header.

   Two more extensions allow to determine the size of the buffer and how
much of it is used.  These functions were also introduced in Solaris.

 -- Function: size_t __fbufsize (FILE *STREAM)
     The '__fbufsize' function return the size of the buffer in the
     stream STREAM.  This value can be used to optimize the use of the
     stream.

     This function is declared in the 'stdio_ext.h' header.

 -- Function: size_t __fpending (FILE *STREAM)
     The '__fpending' function returns the number of bytes currently in
     the output buffer.  For wide-oriented stream the measuring unit is
     wide characters.  This function should not be used on buffers in
     read mode or opened read-only.

     This function is declared in the 'stdio_ext.h' header.

12.21 Other Kinds of Streams
============================

The GNU C Library provides ways for you to define additional kinds of
streams that do not necessarily correspond to an open file.

   One such type of stream takes input from or writes output to a
string.  These kinds of streams are used internally to implement the
'sprintf' and 'sscanf' functions.  You can also create such a stream
explicitly, using the functions described in *note String Streams::.

   More generally, you can define streams that do input/output to
arbitrary objects using functions supplied by your program.  This
protocol is discussed in *note Custom Streams::.

   *Portability Note:* The facilities described in this section are
specific to GNU. Other systems or C implementations might or might not
provide equivalent functionality.

* Menu:

* String Streams::              Streams that get data from or put data in
				 a string or memory buffer.
* Custom Streams::              Defining your own streams with an arbitrary
				 input data source and/or output data sink.


File: libc.info,  Node: String Streams,  Next: Custom Streams,  Up: Other Kinds of Streams

12.21.1 String Streams
----------------------

The 'fmemopen' and 'open_memstream' functions allow you to do I/O to a
string or memory buffer.  These facilities are declared in 'stdio.h'.

 -- Function: FILE * fmemopen (void *BUF, size_t SIZE, const char
          *OPENTYPE)
     This function opens a stream that allows the access specified by
     the OPENTYPE argument, that reads from or writes to the buffer
     specified by the argument BUF.  This array must be at least SIZE
     bytes long.

     If you specify a null pointer as the BUF argument, 'fmemopen'
     dynamically allocates an array SIZE bytes long (as with 'malloc';
     *note Unconstrained Allocation::).  This is really only useful if
     you are going to write things to the buffer and then read them back
     in again, because you have no way of actually getting a pointer to
     the buffer (for this, try 'open_memstream', below).  The buffer is
     freed when the stream is closed.

     The argument OPENTYPE is the same as in 'fopen' (*note Opening
     Streams::).  If the OPENTYPE specifies append mode, then the
     initial file position is set to the first null character in the
     buffer.  Otherwise the initial file position is at the beginning of
     the buffer.

     When a stream open for writing is flushed or closed, a null
     character (zero byte) is written at the end of the buffer if it
     fits.  You should add an extra byte to the SIZE argument to account
     for this.  Attempts to write more than SIZE bytes to the buffer
     result in an error.

     For a stream open for reading, null characters (zero bytes) in the
     buffer do not count as "end of file".  Read operations indicate end
     of file only when the file position advances past SIZE bytes.  So,
     if you want to read characters from a null-terminated string, you
     should supply the length of the string as the SIZE argument.

   Here is an example of using 'fmemopen' to create a stream for reading
from a string:


     #include <stdio.h>

     static char buffer[] = "foobar";

     int
     main (void)
     {
       int ch;
       FILE *stream;

       stream = fmemopen (buffer, strlen (buffer), "r");
       while ((ch = fgetc (stream)) != EOF)
         printf ("Got %c\n", ch);
       fclose (stream);

       return 0;
     }

   This program produces the following output:

     Got f
     Got o
     Got o
     Got b
     Got a
     Got r

 -- Function: FILE * open_memstream (char **PTR, size_t *SIZELOC)
     This function opens a stream for writing to a buffer.  The buffer
     is allocated dynamically and grown as necessary, using 'malloc'.
     After you've closed the stream, this buffer is your responsibility
     to clean up using 'free' or 'realloc'.  *Note Unconstrained
     Allocation::.

     When the stream is closed with 'fclose' or flushed with 'fflush',
     the locations PTR and SIZELOC are updated to contain the pointer to
     the buffer and its size.  The values thus stored remain valid only
     as long as no further output on the stream takes place.  If you do
     more output, you must flush the stream again to store new values
     before you use them again.

     A null character is written at the end of the buffer.  This null
     character is _not_ included in the size value stored at SIZELOC.

     You can move the stream's file position with 'fseek' or 'fseeko'
     (*note File Positioning::).  Moving the file position past the end
     of the data already written fills the intervening space with
     zeroes.

   Here is an example of using 'open_memstream':


     #include <stdio.h>

     int
     main (void)
     {
       char *bp;
       size_t size;
       FILE *stream;

       stream = open_memstream (&bp, &size);
       fprintf (stream, "hello");
       fflush (stream);
       printf ("buf = `%s', size = %d\n", bp, size);
       fprintf (stream, ", world");
       fclose (stream);
       printf ("buf = `%s', size = %d\n", bp, size);

       return 0;
     }

   This program produces the following output:

     buf = `hello', size = 5
     buf = `hello, world', size = 12

12.21.2 Programming Your Own Custom Streams
-------------------------------------------

This section describes how you can make a stream that gets input from an
arbitrary data source or writes output to an arbitrary data sink
programmed by you.  We call these "custom streams".  The functions and
types described here are all GNU extensions.

* Menu:

* Streams and Cookies::         The "cookie" records where to fetch or
				 store data that is read or written.
* Hook Functions::              How you should define the four "hook
				 functions" that a custom stream needs.


File: libc.info,  Node: Streams and Cookies,  Next: Hook Functions,  Up: Custom Streams

12.21.2.1 Custom Streams and Cookies
....................................

Inside every custom stream is a special object called the "cookie".
This is an object supplied by you which records where to fetch or store
the data read or written.  It is up to you to define a data type to use
for the cookie.  The stream functions in the library never refer
directly to its contents, and they don't even know what the type is;
they record its address with type 'void *'.

   To implement a custom stream, you must specify _how_ to fetch or
store the data in the specified place.  You do this by defining "hook
functions" to read, write, change "file position", and close the stream.
All four of these functions will be passed the stream's cookie so they
can tell where to fetch or store the data.  The library functions don't
know what's inside the cookie, but your functions will know.

   When you create a custom stream, you must specify the cookie pointer,
and also the four hook functions stored in a structure of type
'cookie_io_functions_t'.

   These facilities are declared in 'stdio.h'.

 -- Data Type: cookie_io_functions_t
     This is a structure type that holds the functions that define the
     communications protocol between the stream and its cookie.  It has
     the following members:

     'cookie_read_function_t *read'
          This is the function that reads data from the cookie.  If the
          value is a null pointer instead of a function, then read
          operations on this stream always return 'EOF'.

     'cookie_write_function_t *write'
          This is the function that writes data to the cookie.  If the
          value is a null pointer instead of a function, then data
          written to the stream is discarded.

     'cookie_seek_function_t *seek'
          This is the function that performs the equivalent of file
          positioning on the cookie.  If the value is a null pointer
          instead of a function, calls to 'fseek' or 'fseeko' on this
          stream can only seek to locations within the buffer; any
          attempt to seek outside the buffer will return an 'ESPIPE'
          error.

     'cookie_close_function_t *close'
          This function performs any appropriate cleanup on the cookie
          when closing the stream.  If the value is a null pointer
          instead of a function, nothing special is done to close the
          cookie when the stream is closed.

 -- Function: FILE * fopencookie (void *COOKIE, const char *OPENTYPE,
          cookie_io_functions_t IO-FUNCTIONS)
     This function actually creates the stream for communicating with
     the COOKIE using the functions in the IO-FUNCTIONS argument.  The
     OPENTYPE argument is interpreted as for 'fopen'; see *note Opening
     Streams::.  (But note that the "truncate on open" option is
     ignored.)  The new stream is fully buffered.

     The 'fopencookie' function returns the newly created stream, or a
     null pointer in case of an error.


File: libc.info,  Node: Hook Functions,  Prev: Streams and Cookies,  Up: Custom Streams

12.21.2.2 Custom Stream Hook Functions
......................................

Here are more details on how you should define the four hook functions
that a custom stream needs.

   You should define the function to read data from the cookie as:

     ssize_t READER (void *COOKIE, char *BUFFER, size_t SIZE)

   This is very similar to the 'read' function; see *note I/O
Primitives::.  Your function should transfer up to SIZE bytes into the
BUFFER, and return the number of bytes read, or zero to indicate
end-of-file.  You can return a value of '-1' to indicate an error.

   You should define the function to write data to the cookie as:

     ssize_t WRITER (void *COOKIE, const char *BUFFER, size_t SIZE)

   This is very similar to the 'write' function; see *note I/O
Primitives::.  Your function should transfer up to SIZE bytes from the
buffer, and return the number of bytes written.  You can return a value
of '0' to indicate an error.  You must not return any negative value.

   You should define the function to perform seek operations on the
cookie as:

     int SEEKER (void *COOKIE, off64_t *POSITION, int WHENCE)

   For this function, the POSITION and WHENCE arguments are interpreted
as for 'fgetpos'; see *note Portable Positioning::.

   After doing the seek operation, your function should store the
resulting file position relative to the beginning of the file in
POSITION.  Your function should return a value of '0' on success and
'-1' to indicate an error.

   You should define the function to do cleanup operations on the cookie
appropriate for closing the stream as:

     int CLEANER (void *COOKIE)

   Your function should return '-1' to indicate an error, and '0'
otherwise.

 -- Data Type: cookie_read_function
     This is the data type that the read function for a custom stream
     should have.  If you declare the function as shown above, this is
     the type it will have.

 -- Data Type: cookie_write_function
     The data type of the write function for a custom stream.

 -- Data Type: cookie_seek_function
     The data type of the seek function for a custom stream.

 -- Data Type: cookie_close_function
     The data type of the close function for a custom stream.

12.22 Formatted Messages
========================

On systems which are based on System V messages of programs (especially
the system tools) are printed in a strict form using the 'fmtmsg'
function.  The uniformity sometimes helps the user to interpret messages
and the strictness tests of the 'fmtmsg' function ensure that the
programmer follows some minimal requirements.

* Menu:

* Printing Formatted Messages::   The 'fmtmsg' function.
* Adding Severity Classes::       Add more severity classes.
* Example::                       How to use 'fmtmsg' and 'addseverity'.


File: libc.info,  Node: Printing Formatted Messages,  Next: Adding Severity Classes,  Up: Formatted Messages

12.22.1 Printing Formatted Messages
-----------------------------------

Messages can be printed to standard error and/or to the console.  To
select the destination the programmer can use the following two values,
bitwise OR combined if wanted, for the CLASSIFICATION parameter of
'fmtmsg':

'MM_PRINT'
     Display the message in standard error.
'MM_CONSOLE'
     Display the message on the system console.

   The erroneous piece of the system can be signalled by exactly one of
the following values which also is bitwise ORed with the CLASSIFICATION
parameter to 'fmtmsg':

'MM_HARD'
     The source of the condition is some hardware.
'MM_SOFT'
     The source of the condition is some software.
'MM_FIRM'
     The source of the condition is some firmware.

   A third component of the CLASSIFICATION parameter to 'fmtmsg' can
describe the part of the system which detects the problem.  This is done
by using exactly one of the following values:

'MM_APPL'
     The erroneous condition is detected by the application.
'MM_UTIL'
     The erroneous condition is detected by a utility.
'MM_OPSYS'
     The erroneous condition is detected by the operating system.

   A last component of CLASSIFICATION can signal the results of this
message.  Exactly one of the following values can be used:

'MM_RECOVER'
     It is a recoverable error.
'MM_NRECOV'
     It is a non-recoverable error.

 -- Function: int fmtmsg (long int CLASSIFICATION, const char *LABEL,
          int SEVERITY, const char *TEXT, const char *ACTION, const char
          *TAG)
     Display a message described by its parameters on the device(s)
     specified in the CLASSIFICATION parameter.  The LABEL parameter
     identifies the source of the message.  The string should consist of
     two colon separated parts where the first part has not more than 10
     and the second part not more than 14 characters.  The TEXT
     parameter describes the condition of the error, the ACTION
     parameter possible steps to recover from the error and the TAG
     parameter is a reference to the online documentation where more
     information can be found.  It should contain the LABEL value and a
     unique identification number.

     Each of the parameters can be a special value which means this
     value is to be omitted.  The symbolic names for these values are:

     'MM_NULLLBL'
          Ignore LABEL parameter.
     'MM_NULLSEV'
          Ignore SEVERITY parameter.
     'MM_NULLMC'
          Ignore CLASSIFICATION parameter.  This implies that nothing is
          actually printed.
     'MM_NULLTXT'
          Ignore TEXT parameter.
     'MM_NULLACT'
          Ignore ACTION parameter.
     'MM_NULLTAG'
          Ignore TAG parameter.

     There is another way certain fields can be omitted from the output
     to standard error.  This is described below in the description of
     environment variables influencing the behavior.

     The SEVERITY parameter can have one of the values in the following
     table:

     'MM_NOSEV'
          Nothing is printed, this value is the same as 'MM_NULLSEV'.
     'MM_HALT'
          This value is printed as 'HALT'.
     'MM_ERROR'
          This value is printed as 'ERROR'.
     'MM_WARNING'
          This value is printed as 'WARNING'.
     'MM_INFO'
          This value is printed as 'INFO'.

     The numeric value of these five macros are between '0' and '4'.
     Using the environment variable 'SEV_LEVEL' or using the
     'addseverity' function one can add more severity levels with their
     corresponding string to print.  This is described below (*note
     Adding Severity Classes::).

     If no parameter is ignored the output looks like this:

          LABEL: SEVERITY-STRING: TEXT
          TO FIX: ACTION TAG

     The colons, new line characters and the 'TO FIX' string are
     inserted if necessary, i.e., if the corresponding parameter is not
     ignored.

     This function is specified in the X/Open Portability Guide.  It is
     also available on all systems derived from System V.

     The function returns the value 'MM_OK' if no error occurred.  If
     only the printing to standard error failed, it returns 'MM_NOMSG'.
     If printing to the console fails, it returns 'MM_NOCON'.  If
     nothing is printed 'MM_NOTOK' is returned.  Among situations where
     all outputs fail this last value is also returned if a parameter
     value is incorrect.

   There are two environment variables which influence the behavior of
'fmtmsg'.  The first is 'MSGVERB'.  It is used to control the output
actually happening on standard error (_not_ the console output).  Each
of the five fields can explicitly be enabled.  To do this the user has
to put the 'MSGVERB' variable with a format like the following in the
environment before calling the 'fmtmsg' function the first time:

     MSGVERB=KEYWORD[:KEYWORD[:...]]

   Valid KEYWORDs are 'label', 'severity', 'text', 'action', and 'tag'.
If the environment variable is not given or is the empty string, a not
supported keyword is given or the value is somehow else invalid, no part
of the message is masked out.

   The second environment variable which influences the behavior of
'fmtmsg' is 'SEV_LEVEL'.  This variable and the change in the behavior
of 'fmtmsg' is not specified in the X/Open Portability Guide.  It is
available in System V systems, though.  It can be used to introduce new
severity levels.  By default, only the five severity levels described
above are available.  Any other numeric value would make 'fmtmsg' print
nothing.

   If the user puts 'SEV_LEVEL' with a format like

     SEV_LEVEL=[DESCRIPTION[:DESCRIPTION[:...]]]

in the environment of the process before the first call to 'fmtmsg',
where DESCRIPTION has a value of the form

     SEVERITY-KEYWORD,LEVEL,PRINTSTRING

   The SEVERITY-KEYWORD part is not used by 'fmtmsg' but it has to be
present.  The LEVEL part is a string representation of a number.  The
numeric value must be a number greater than 4.  This value must be used
in the SEVERITY parameter of 'fmtmsg' to select this class.  It is not
possible to overwrite any of the predefined classes.  The PRINTSTRING is
the string printed when a message of this class is processed by 'fmtmsg'
(see above, 'fmtsmg' does not print the numeric value but instead the
string representation).


File: libc.info,  Node: Adding Severity Classes,  Next: Example,  Prev: Printing Formatted Messages,  Up: Formatted Messages

12.22.2 Adding Severity Classes
-------------------------------

There is another possibility to introduce severity classes besides using
the environment variable 'SEV_LEVEL'.  This simplifies the task of
introducing new classes in a running program.  One could use the
'setenv' or 'putenv' function to set the environment variable, but this
is toilsome.

 -- Function: int addseverity (int SEVERITY, const char *STRING)
     This function allows the introduction of new severity classes which
     can be addressed by the SEVERITY parameter of the 'fmtmsg'
     function.  The SEVERITY parameter of 'addseverity' must match the
     value for the parameter with the same name of 'fmtmsg', and STRING
     is the string printed in the actual messages instead of the numeric
     value.

     If STRING is 'NULL' the severity class with the numeric value
     according to SEVERITY is removed.

     It is not possible to overwrite or remove one of the default
     severity classes.  All calls to 'addseverity' with SEVERITY set to
     one of the values for the default classes will fail.

     The return value is 'MM_OK' if the task was successfully performed.
     If the return value is 'MM_NOTOK' something went wrong.  This could
     mean that no more memory is available or a class is not available
     when it has to be removed.

     This function is not specified in the X/Open Portability Guide
     although the 'fmtsmg' function is.  It is available on System V
     systems.


File: libc.info,  Node: Example,  Prev: Adding Severity Classes,  Up: Formatted Messages

12.22.3 How to use 'fmtmsg' and 'addseverity'
---------------------------------------------

Here is a simple example program to illustrate the use of the both
functions described in this section.


     #include <fmtmsg.h>

     int
     main (void)
     {
       addseverity (5, "NOTE2");
       fmtmsg (MM_PRINT, "only1field", MM_INFO, "text2", "action2", "tag2");
       fmtmsg (MM_PRINT, "UX:cat", 5, "invalid syntax", "refer to manual",
               "UX:cat:001");
       fmtmsg (MM_PRINT, "label:foo", 6, "text", "action", "tag");
       return 0;
     }

   The second call to 'fmtmsg' illustrates a use of this function as it
usually occurs on System V systems, which heavily use this function.  It
seems worthwhile to give a short explanation here of how this system
works on System V. The value of the LABEL field ('UX:cat') says that the
error occurred in the Unix program 'cat'.  The explanation of the error
follows and the value for the ACTION parameter is '"refer to manual"'.
One could be more specific here, if necessary.  The TAG field contains,
as proposed above, the value of the string given for the LABEL
parameter, and additionally a unique ID ('001' in this case).  For a GNU
environment this string could contain a reference to the corresponding
node in the Info page for the program.

Running this program without specifying the 'MSGVERB' and 'SEV_LEVEL'
function produces the following output:

     UX:cat: NOTE2: invalid syntax
     TO FIX: refer to manual UX:cat:001

   We see the different fields of the message and how the extra glue
(the colons and the 'TO FIX' string) are printed.  But only one of the
three calls to 'fmtmsg' produced output.  The first call does not print
anything because the LABEL parameter is not in the correct form.  The
string must contain two fields, separated by a colon (*note Printing
Formatted Messages::).  The third 'fmtmsg' call produced no output since
the class with the numeric value '6' is not defined.  Although a class
with numeric value '5' is also not defined by default, the call to
'addseverity' introduces it and the second call to 'fmtmsg' produces the
above output.

   When we change the environment of the program to contain
'SEV_LEVEL=XXX,6,NOTE' when running it we get a different result:

     UX:cat: NOTE2: invalid syntax
     TO FIX: refer to manual UX:cat:001
     label:foo: NOTE: text
     TO FIX: action tag

   Now the third call to 'fmtmsg' produced some output and we see how
the string 'NOTE' from the environment variable appears in the message.

   Now we can reduce the output by specifying which fields we are
interested in.  If we additionally set the environment variable
'MSGVERB' to the value 'severity:label:action' we get the following
output:

     UX:cat: NOTE2
     TO FIX: refer to manual
     label:foo: NOTE
     TO FIX: action

I.e., the output produced by the TEXT and the TAG parameters to 'fmtmsg'
vanished.  Please also note that now there is no colon after the 'NOTE'
and 'NOTE2' strings in the output.  This is not necessary since there is
no more output on this line because the text is missing.

13 Low-Level Input/Output
*************************

This chapter describes functions for performing low-level input/output
operations on file descriptors.  These functions include the primitives
for the higher-level I/O functions described in *note I/O on Streams::,
as well as functions for performing low-level control operations for
which there are no equivalents on streams.

   Stream-level I/O is more flexible and usually more convenient;
therefore, programmers generally use the descriptor-level functions only
when necessary.  These are some of the usual reasons:

   * For reading binary files in large chunks.

   * For reading an entire file into core before parsing it.

   * To perform operations other than data transfer, which can only be
     done with a descriptor.  (You can use 'fileno' to get the
     descriptor corresponding to a stream.)

   * To pass descriptors to a child process.  (The child can create its
     own stream to use a descriptor that it inherits, but cannot inherit
     a stream directly.)

13.1 Opening and Closing Files
==============================

This section describes the primitives for opening and closing files
using file descriptors.  The 'open' and 'creat' functions are declared
in the header file 'fcntl.h', while 'close' is declared in 'unistd.h'.

 -- Function: int open (const char *FILENAME, int FLAGS[, mode_t MODE])
     The 'open' function creates and returns a new file descriptor for
     the file named by FILENAME.  Initially, the file position indicator
     for the file is at the beginning of the file.  The argument MODE
     (*note Permission Bits::) is used only when a file is created, but
     it doesn't hurt to supply the argument in any case.

     The FLAGS argument controls how the file is to be opened.  This is
     a bit mask; you create the value by the bitwise OR of the
     appropriate parameters (using the '|' operator in C). *Note File
     Status Flags::, for the parameters available.

     The normal return value from 'open' is a non-negative integer file
     descriptor.  In the case of an error, a value of -1 is returned
     instead.  In addition to the usual file name errors (*note File
     Name Errors::), the following 'errno' error conditions are defined
     for this function:

     'EACCES'
          The file exists but is not readable/writable as requested by
          the FLAGS argument, the file does not exist and the directory
          is unwritable so it cannot be created.

     'EEXIST'
          Both 'O_CREAT' and 'O_EXCL' are set, and the named file
          already exists.

     'EINTR'
          The 'open' operation was interrupted by a signal.  *Note
          Interrupted Primitives::.

     'EISDIR'
          The FLAGS argument specified write access, and the file is a
          directory.

     'EMFILE'
          The process has too many files open.  The maximum number of
          file descriptors is controlled by the 'RLIMIT_NOFILE' resource
          limit; *note Limits on Resources::.

     'ENFILE'
          The entire system, or perhaps the file system which contains
          the directory, cannot support any additional open files at the
          moment.  (This problem cannot happen on GNU/Hurd systems.)

     'ENOENT'
          The named file does not exist, and 'O_CREAT' is not specified.

     'ENOSPC'
          The directory or file system that would contain the new file
          cannot be extended, because there is no disk space left.

     'ENXIO'
          'O_NONBLOCK' and 'O_WRONLY' are both set in the FLAGS
          argument, the file named by FILENAME is a FIFO (*note Pipes
          and FIFOs::), and no process has the file open for reading.

     'EROFS'
          The file resides on a read-only file system and any of
          'O_WRONLY', 'O_RDWR', and 'O_TRUNC' are set in the FLAGS
          argument, or 'O_CREAT' is set and the file does not already
          exist.

     If on a 32 bit machine the sources are translated with
     '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' the function 'open' returns a file
     descriptor opened in the large file mode which enables the file
     handling functions to use files up to 2^63 bytes in size and offset
     from -2^63 to 2^63.  This happens transparently for the user since
     all of the lowlevel file handling functions are equally replaced.

     This function is a cancellation point in multi-threaded programs.
     This is a problem if the thread allocates some resources (like
     memory, file descriptors, semaphores or whatever) at the time
     'open' is called.  If the thread gets canceled these resources stay
     allocated until the program ends.  To avoid this calls to 'open'
     should be protected using cancellation handlers.

     The 'open' function is the underlying primitive for the 'fopen' and
     'freopen' functions, that create streams.

 -- Function: int open64 (const char *FILENAME, int FLAGS[, mode_t
          MODE])
     This function is similar to 'open'.  It returns a file descriptor
     which can be used to access the file named by FILENAME.  The only
     difference is that on 32 bit systems the file is opened in the
     large file mode.  I.e., file length and file offsets can exceed 31
     bits.

     When the sources are translated with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is actually available under the name 'open'.  I.e., the
     new, extended API using 64 bit file sizes and offsets transparently
     replaces the old API.

 -- Obsolete function: int creat (const char *FILENAME, mode_t MODE)
     This function is obsolete.  The call:

          creat (FILENAME, MODE)

     is equivalent to:

          open (FILENAME, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, MODE)

     If on a 32 bit machine the sources are translated with
     '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' the function 'creat' returns a file
     descriptor opened in the large file mode which enables the file
     handling functions to use files up to 2^63 in size and offset from
     -2^63 to 2^63.  This happens transparently for the user since all
     of the lowlevel file handling functions are equally replaced.

 -- Obsolete function: int creat64 (const char *FILENAME, mode_t MODE)
     This function is similar to 'creat'.  It returns a file descriptor
     which can be used to access the file named by FILENAME.  The only
     the difference is that on 32 bit systems the file is opened in the
     large file mode.  I.e., file length and file offsets can exceed 31
     bits.

     To use this file descriptor one must not use the normal operations
     but instead the counterparts named '*64', e.g., 'read64'.

     When the sources are translated with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this
     function is actually available under the name 'open'.  I.e., the
     new, extended API using 64 bit file sizes and offsets transparently
     replaces the old API.

 -- Function: int close (int FILEDES)
     The function 'close' closes the file descriptor FILEDES.  Closing a
     file has the following consequences:

        * The file descriptor is deallocated.

        * Any record locks owned by the process on the file are
          unlocked.

        * When all file descriptors associated with a pipe or FIFO have
          been closed, any unread data is discarded.

     This function is a cancellation point in multi-threaded programs.
     This is a problem if the thread allocates some resources (like
     memory, file descriptors, semaphores or whatever) at the time
     'close' is called.  If the thread gets canceled these resources
     stay allocated until the program ends.  To avoid this, calls to
     'close' should be protected using cancellation handlers.

     The normal return value from 'close' is 0; a value of -1 is
     returned in case of failure.  The following 'errno' error
     conditions are defined for this function:

     'EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is not a valid file descriptor.

     'EINTR'
          The 'close' call was interrupted by a signal.  *Note
          Interrupted Primitives::.  Here is an example of how to handle
          'EINTR' properly:

               TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY (close (desc));

     'ENOSPC'
     'EIO'
     'EDQUOT'
          When the file is accessed by NFS, these errors from 'write'
          can sometimes not be detected until 'close'.  *Note I/O
          Primitives::, for details on their meaning.

     Please note that there is _no_ separate 'close64' function.  This
     is not necessary since this function does not determine nor depend
     on the mode of the file.  The kernel which performs the 'close'
     operation knows which mode the descriptor is used for and can
     handle this situation.

   To close a stream, call 'fclose' (*note Closing Streams::) instead of
trying to close its underlying file descriptor with 'close'.  This
flushes any buffered output and updates the stream object to indicate
that it is closed.

13.2 Input and Output Primitives
================================

This section describes the functions for performing primitive input and
output operations on file descriptors: 'read', 'write', and 'lseek'.
These functions are declared in the header file 'unistd.h'.

 -- Data Type: ssize_t
     This data type is used to represent the sizes of blocks that can be
     read or written in a single operation.  It is similar to 'size_t',
     but must be a signed type.

 -- Function: ssize_t read (int FILEDES, void *BUFFER, size_t SIZE)
     The 'read' function reads up to SIZE bytes from the file with
     descriptor FILEDES, storing the results in the BUFFER.  (This is
     not necessarily a character string, and no terminating null
     character is added.)

     The return value is the number of bytes actually read.  This might
     be less than SIZE; for example, if there aren't that many bytes
     left in the file or if there aren't that many bytes immediately
     available.  The exact behavior depends on what kind of file it is.
     Note that reading less than SIZE bytes is not an error.

     A value of zero indicates end-of-file (except if the value of the
     SIZE argument is also zero).  This is not considered an error.  If
     you keep calling 'read' while at end-of-file, it will keep
     returning zero and doing nothing else.

     If 'read' returns at least one character, there is no way you can
     tell whether end-of-file was reached.  But if you did reach the
     end, the next read will return zero.

     In case of an error, 'read' returns -1.  The following 'errno'
     error conditions are defined for this function:

     'EAGAIN'
          Normally, when no input is immediately available, 'read' waits
          for some input.  But if the 'O_NONBLOCK' flag is set for the
          file (*note File Status Flags::), 'read' returns immediately
          without reading any data, and reports this error.

          *Compatibility Note:* Most versions of BSD Unix use a
          different error code for this: 'EWOULDBLOCK'.  In the GNU C
          Library, 'EWOULDBLOCK' is an alias for 'EAGAIN', so it doesn't
          matter which name you use.

          On some systems, reading a large amount of data from a
          character special file can also fail with 'EAGAIN' if the
          kernel cannot find enough physical memory to lock down the
          user's pages.  This is limited to devices that transfer with
          direct memory access into the user's memory, which means it
          does not include terminals, since they always use separate
          buffers inside the kernel.  This problem never happens on
          GNU/Hurd systems.

          Any condition that could result in 'EAGAIN' can instead result
          in a successful 'read' which returns fewer bytes than
          requested.  Calling 'read' again immediately would result in
          'EAGAIN'.

     'EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is not a valid file descriptor, or is not
          open for reading.

     'EINTR'
          'read' was interrupted by a signal while it was waiting for
          input.  *Note Interrupted Primitives::.  A signal will not
          necessary cause 'read' to return 'EINTR'; it may instead
          result in a successful 'read' which returns fewer bytes than
          requested.

     'EIO'
          For many devices, and for disk files, this error code
          indicates a hardware error.

          'EIO' also occurs when a background process tries to read from
          the controlling terminal, and the normal action of stopping
          the process by sending it a 'SIGTTIN' signal isn't working.
          This might happen if the signal is being blocked or ignored,
          or because the process group is orphaned.  *Note Job
          Control::, for more information about job control, and *note
          Signal Handling::, for information about signals.

     'EINVAL'
          In some systems, when reading from a character or block
          device, position and size offsets must be aligned to a
          particular block size.  This error indicates that the offsets
          were not properly aligned.

     Please note that there is no function named 'read64'.  This is not
     necessary since this function does not directly modify or handle
     the possibly wide file offset.  Since the kernel handles this state
     internally, the 'read' function can be used for all cases.

     This function is a cancellation point in multi-threaded programs.
     This is a problem if the thread allocates some resources (like
     memory, file descriptors, semaphores or whatever) at the time
     'read' is called.  If the thread gets canceled these resources stay
     allocated until the program ends.  To avoid this, calls to 'read'
     should be protected using cancellation handlers.

     The 'read' function is the underlying primitive for all of the
     functions that read from streams, such as 'fgetc'.

 -- Function: ssize_t pread (int FILEDES, void *BUFFER, size_t SIZE,
          off_t OFFSET)
     The 'pread' function is similar to the 'read' function.  The first
     three arguments are identical, and the return values and error
     codes also correspond.

     The difference is the fourth argument and its handling.  The data
     block is not read from the current position of the file descriptor
     'filedes'.  Instead the data is read from the file starting at
     position OFFSET.  The position of the file descriptor itself is not
     affected by the operation.  The value is the same as before the
     call.

     When the source file is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' the
     'pread' function is in fact 'pread64' and the type 'off_t' has 64
     bits, which makes it possible to handle files up to 2^63 bytes in
     length.

     The return value of 'pread' describes the number of bytes read.  In
     the error case it returns -1 like 'read' does and the error codes
     are also the same, with these additions:

     'EINVAL'
          The value given for OFFSET is negative and therefore illegal.

     'ESPIPE'
          The file descriptor FILEDES is associate with a pipe or a FIFO
          and this device does not allow positioning of the file
          pointer.

     The function is an extension defined in the Unix Single
     Specification version 2.

 -- Function: ssize_t pread64 (int FILEDES, void *BUFFER, size_t SIZE,
          off64_t OFFSET)
     This function is similar to the 'pread' function.  The difference
     is that the OFFSET parameter is of type 'off64_t' instead of
     'off_t' which makes it possible on 32 bit machines to address files
     larger than 2^31 bytes and up to 2^63 bytes.  The file descriptor
     'filedes' must be opened using 'open64' since otherwise the large
     offsets possible with 'off64_t' will lead to errors with a
     descriptor in small file mode.

     When the source file is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on
     a 32 bit machine this function is actually available under the name
     'pread' and so transparently replaces the 32 bit interface.

 -- Function: ssize_t write (int FILEDES, const void *BUFFER, size_t
          SIZE)
     The 'write' function writes up to SIZE bytes from BUFFER to the
     file with descriptor FILEDES.  The data in BUFFER is not
     necessarily a character string and a null character is output like
     any other character.

     The return value is the number of bytes actually written.  This may
     be SIZE, but can always be smaller.  Your program should always
     call 'write' in a loop, iterating until all the data is written.

     Once 'write' returns, the data is enqueued to be written and can be
     read back right away, but it is not necessarily written out to
     permanent storage immediately.  You can use 'fsync' when you need
     to be sure your data has been permanently stored before continuing.
     (It is more efficient for the system to batch up consecutive writes
     and do them all at once when convenient.  Normally they will always
     be written to disk within a minute or less.)  Modern systems
     provide another function 'fdatasync' which guarantees integrity
     only for the file data and is therefore faster.  You can use the
     'O_FSYNC' open mode to make 'write' always store the data to disk
     before returning; *note Operating Modes::.

     In the case of an error, 'write' returns -1.  The following 'errno'
     error conditions are defined for this function:

     'EAGAIN'
          Normally, 'write' blocks until the write operation is
          complete.  But if the 'O_NONBLOCK' flag is set for the file
          (*note Control Operations::), it returns immediately without
          writing any data and reports this error.  An example of a
          situation that might cause the process to block on output is
          writing to a terminal device that supports flow control, where
          output has been suspended by receipt of a STOP character.

          *Compatibility Note:* Most versions of BSD Unix use a
          different error code for this: 'EWOULDBLOCK'.  In the GNU C
          Library, 'EWOULDBLOCK' is an alias for 'EAGAIN', so it doesn't
          matter which name you use.

          On some systems, writing a large amount of data from a
          character special file can also fail with 'EAGAIN' if the
          kernel cannot find enough physical memory to lock down the
          user's pages.  This is limited to devices that transfer with
          direct memory access into the user's memory, which means it
          does not include terminals, since they always use separate
          buffers inside the kernel.  This problem does not arise on
          GNU/Hurd systems.

     'EBADF'
          The FILEDES argument is not a valid file descriptor, or is not
          open for writing.

     'EFBIG'
          The size of the file would become larger than the
          implementation can support.

     'EINTR'
          The 'write' operation was interrupted by a signal while it was
          blocked waiting for completion.  A signal will not necessarily
          cause 'write' to return 'EINTR'; it may instead result in a
          successful 'write' which writes fewer bytes than requested.
          *Note Interrupted Primitives::.

     'EIO'
          For many devices, and for disk files, this error code
          indicates a hardware error.

     'ENOSPC'
          The device containing the file is full.

     'EPIPE'
          This error is returned when you try to write to a pipe or FIFO
          that isn't open for reading by any process.  When this
          happens, a 'SIGPIPE' signal is also sent to the process; see
          *note Signal Handling::.

     'EINVAL'
          In some systems, when writing to a character or block device,
          position and size offsets must be aligned to a particular
          block size.  This error indicates that the offsets were not
          properly aligned.

     Unless you have arranged to prevent 'EINTR' failures, you should
     check 'errno' after each failing call to 'write', and if the error
     was 'EINTR', you should simply repeat the call.  *Note Interrupted
     Primitives::.  The easy way to do this is with the macro
     'TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY', as follows:

          nbytes = TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY (write (desc, buffer, count));

     Please note that there is no function named 'write64'.  This is not
     necessary since this function does not directly modify or handle
     the possibly wide file offset.  Since the kernel handles this state
     internally the 'write' function can be used for all cases.

     This function is a cancellation point in multi-threaded programs.
     This is a problem if the thread allocates some resources (like
     memory, file descriptors, semaphores or whatever) at the time
     'write' is called.  If the thread gets canceled these resources
     stay allocated until the program ends.  To avoid this, calls to
     'write' should be protected using cancellation handlers.

     The 'write' function is the underlying primitive for all of the
     functions that write to streams, such as 'fputc'.

 -- Function: ssize_t pwrite (int FILEDES, const void *BUFFER, size_t
          SIZE, off_t OFFSET)
     The 'pwrite' function is similar to the 'write' function.  The
     first three arguments are identical, and the return values and
     error codes also correspond.

     The difference is the fourth argument and its handling.  The data
     block is not written to the current position of the file descriptor
     'filedes'.  Instead the data is written to the file starting at
     position OFFSET.  The position of the file descriptor itself is not
     affected by the operation.  The value is the same as before the
     call.

     When the source file is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' the
     'pwrite' function is in fact 'pwrite64' and the type 'off_t' has 64
     bits, which makes it possible to handle files up to 2^63 bytes in
     length.

     The return value of 'pwrite' describes the number of written bytes.
     In the error case it returns -1 like 'write' does and the error
     codes are also the same, with these additions:

     'EINVAL'
          The value given for OFFSET is negative and therefore illegal.

     'ESPIPE'
          The file descriptor FILEDES is associated with a pipe or a
          FIFO and this device does not allow positioning of the file
          pointer.

     The function is an extension defined in the Unix Single
     Specification version 2.

 -- Function: ssize_t pwrite64 (int FILEDES, const void *BUFFER, size_t
          SIZE, off64_t OFFSET)
     This function is similar to the 'pwrite' function.  The difference
     is that the OFFSET parameter is of type 'off64_t' instead of
     'off_t' which makes it possible on 32 bit machines to address files
     larger than 2^31 bytes and up to 2^63 bytes.  The file descriptor
     'filedes' must be opened using 'open64' since otherwise the large
     offsets possible with 'off64_t' will lead to errors with a
     descriptor in small file mode.

     When the source file is compiled using '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on
     a 32 bit machine this function is actually available under the name
     'pwrite' and so transparently replaces the 32 bit interface.

13.3 Setting the File Position of a Descriptor
==============================================

Just as you can set the file position of a stream with 'fseek', you can
set the file position of a descriptor with 'lseek'.  This specifies the
position in the file for the next 'read' or 'write' operation.  *Note
File Positioning::, for more information on the file position and what
it means.

   To read the current file position value from a descriptor, use 'lseek
(DESC, 0, SEEK_CUR)'.

 -- Function: off_t lseek (int FILEDES, off_t OFFSET, int WHENCE)
     The 'lseek' function is used to change the file position of the
     file with descriptor FILEDES.

     The WHENCE argument specifies how the OFFSET should be interpreted,
     in the same way as for the 'fseek' function, and it must be one of
     the symbolic constants 'SEEK_SET', 'SEEK_CUR', or 'SEEK_END'.

     'SEEK_SET'
          Specifies that OFFSET is a count of characters from the
          beginning of the file.

     'SEEK_CUR'
          Specifies that OFFSET is a count of characters from the
          current file position.  This count may be positive or
          negative.

     'SEEK_END'
          Specifies that OFFSET is a count of characters from the end of
          the file.  A negative count specifies a position within the
          current extent of the file; a positive count specifies a
          position past the current end.  If you set the position past
          the current end, and actually write data, you will extend the
          file with zeros up to that position.

     The return value from 'lseek' is normally the resulting file
     position, measured in bytes from the beginning of the file.  You
     can use this feature together with 'SEEK_CUR' to read the current
     file position.

     If you want to append to the file, setting the file position to the
     current end of file with 'SEEK_END' is not sufficient.  Another
     process may write more data after you seek but before you write,
     extending the file so the position you write onto clobbers their
     data.  Instead, use the 'O_APPEND' operating mode; *note Operating
     Modes::.

     You can set the file position past the current end of the file.
     This does not by itself make the file longer; 'lseek' never changes
     the file.  But subsequent output at that position will extend the
     file.  Characters between the previous end of file and the new
     position are filled with zeros.  Extending the file in this way can
     create a "hole": the blocks of zeros are not actually allocated on
     disk, so the file takes up less space than it appears to; it is
     then called a "sparse file".

     If the file position cannot be changed, or the operation is in some
     way invalid, 'lseek' returns a value of -1.  The following 'errno'
     error conditions are defined for this function:

     'EBADF'
          The FILEDES is not a valid file descriptor.

     'EINVAL'
          The WHENCE argument value is not valid, or the resulting file
          offset is not valid.  A file offset is invalid.

     'ESPIPE'
          The FILEDES corresponds to an object that cannot be
          positioned, such as a pipe, FIFO or terminal device.  (POSIX.1
          specifies this error only for pipes and FIFOs, but on GNU
          systems, you always get 'ESPIPE' if the object is not
          seekable.)

     When the source file is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' the
     'lseek' function is in fact 'lseek64' and the type 'off_t' has 64
     bits which makes it possible to handle files up to 2^63 bytes in
     length.

     This function is a cancellation point in multi-threaded programs.
     This is a problem if the thread allocates some resources (like
     memory, file descriptors, semaphores or whatever) at the time
     'lseek' is called.  If the thread gets canceled these resources
     stay allocated until the program ends.  To avoid this calls to
     'lseek' should be protected using cancellation handlers.

     The 'lseek' function is the underlying primitive for the 'fseek',
     'fseeko', 'ftell', 'ftello' and 'rewind' functions, which operate
     on streams instead of file descriptors.

 -- Function: off64_t lseek64 (int FILEDES, off64_t OFFSET, int WHENCE)
     This function is similar to the 'lseek' function.  The difference
     is that the OFFSET parameter is of type 'off64_t' instead of
     'off_t' which makes it possible on 32 bit machines to address files
     larger than 2^31 bytes and up to 2^63 bytes.  The file descriptor
     'filedes' must be opened using 'open64' since otherwise the large
     offsets possible with 'off64_t' will lead to errors with a
     descriptor in small file mode.

     When the source file is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' on
     a 32 bits machine this function is actually available under the
     name 'lseek' and so transparently replaces the 32 bit interface.

   You can have multiple descriptors for the same file if you open the
file more than once, or if you duplicate a descriptor with 'dup'.
Descriptors that come from separate calls to 'open' have independent
file positions; using 'lseek' on one descriptor has no effect on the
other.  For example,

     {
       int d1, d2;
       char buf[4];
       d1 = open ("foo", O_RDONLY);
       d2 = open ("foo", O_RDONLY);
       lseek (d1, 1024, SEEK_SET);
       read (d2, buf, 4);
     }

will read the first four characters of the file 'foo'.  (The
error-checking code necessary for a real program has been omitted here
for brevity.)

   By contrast, descriptors made by duplication share a common file
position with the original descriptor that was duplicated.  Anything
which alters the file position of one of the duplicates, including
reading or writing data, affects all of them alike.  Thus, for example,

     {
       int d1, d2, d3;
       char buf1[4], buf2[4];
       d1 = open ("foo", O_RDONLY);
       d2 = dup (d1);
       d3 = dup (d2);
       lseek (d3, 1024, SEEK_SET);
       read (d1, buf1, 4);
       read (d2, buf2, 4);
     }

will read four characters starting with the 1024'th character of 'foo',
and then four more characters starting with the 1028'th character.

 -- Data Type: off_t
     This is a signed integer type used to represent file sizes.  In the
     GNU C Library, this type is no narrower than 'int'.

     If the source is compiled with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this type
     is transparently replaced by 'off64_t'.

 -- Data Type: off64_t
     This type is used similar to 'off_t'.  The difference is that even
     on 32 bit machines, where the 'off_t' type would have 32 bits,
     'off64_t' has 64 bits and so is able to address files up to 2^63
     bytes in length.

     When compiling with '_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64' this type is
     available under the name 'off_t'.

   These aliases for the 'SEEK_...' constants exist for the sake of
compatibility with older BSD systems.  They are defined in two different
header files: 'fcntl.h' and 'sys/file.h'.

'L_SET'
     An alias for 'SEEK_SET'.

'L_INCR'
     An alias for 'SEEK_CUR'.

'L_XTND'
     An alias for 'SEEK_END'.
